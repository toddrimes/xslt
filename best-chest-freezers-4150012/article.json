The GE FCM11PHWW is a great pick, as it can work in temperatures ranging from 0 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

An average chest freezer typically has about 15 cubic feet of interior space, which is about 112 liquid gallons. When you're shopping for a new model, you'll want to keep in mind that more capacity means the model will be wider and take up a larger spot in your garage or home. Finding the balance between storage and living space may be essential.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Organization options","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Unlike upright freezers, chest freezers don't usually have shelving that helps keep your frozen goods organized. Instead, chest freezers have dividers and baskets, which you can use to separate dinners from meats, fruit, or baked goods. The average chest freezer has two or three storage baskets, while more spacious and high-end models may have up to five. Some of these baskets can be sliding, and others will be removable, which is ideal for a manually-defrosting model.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Manual vs. automatic defrosting","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"If your chest freezer manually defrosts, then you will need to maintain it when ice and frost builds up in the interior. Once the build up becomes a quarter-inch thick, you'll need to unplug your model, take everything out of it, and chip away at the ice and frost. After the ice and frost has been removed and is melted away, you can drain the unit and plug it back in. If your chest freezer automatically defrosts, or is considered frost-free or self-defrosting, internal coils will occasionally heat up and keep frost at bay. This option is more expensive to operate, and purchase upfront, but is easier to use.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading2","text":"Standout Features","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Safety lock","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"If your chest freezer has a safety lock, you're able to secure what you're storing inside. This feature is particularly handy if you plan on leaving your freezer in a garage, or frequently entertain. You can lock the appliance and feel comfortable knowing that there will be no unwanted entry. Typically, the safety lock is paired with a physical key or key fob, which you should store in a safe, accessible spot.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Garage-ready design","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Any household that wants extra storage, but doesn't want to set up a bulky appliance in their kitchen should look for a chest freezer with a garage-ready design. This type of design ensures the appliance will run properly, whether the external temperature is very hot or very cold. In other words, your goods won't go bad, and will remain in a stable internal environment. Not all freezers are garage-ready, so it's important to look for this feature.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Exterior power light","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"It can be hard to tell if your chest freezer is on and running. Even if it's plugged in, without any sort of indicator, you may worry the appliance isn't properly storing your food. An exterior power light creates a small glow on the ground near the appliance, so you know it's working properly. It's very suitable for households that aren't quick to trust their appliances, and are planning to keep their chest freezer on at all times.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading2","text":"FAQs","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"How long does a chest freezer last?","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"On average, a chest freezer lasts 14 years. This is longer than a standard refrigerator, which typically lasts around 10 years. You can extend your freezer's lifespan by properly maintaining it and storing it in the proper conditions. For example, if your freezer is not a garage-ready model, keep it in a kitchen or temperature-controlled basement. Make sure there's no ice build up, and manually defrost it when needed. In addition, make sure the lid is closed tight after opening it, so the unit doesn't have to work harder than usual.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"How do I organize a chest freezer?","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"When it comes to organizing a chest freezer, you'll want to really make use of the included baskets or dividers. Group similar items together, and give them their own designated basket. Stack baskets and bins for easy access to the items you need. In addition, label your meats, fruits, and vegetables with a \"best by\" date, and put the oldest items on top, so you know to use them first.

This is because of the quality of their insulation, which lines the walls and even helps keep your food cold during power outages. On average, a chest freezer will use 250 kWh per year, while upright freezers can use almost 500 kWH per year. If you don't fill your freezer to the brim and care for it properly, this number may go down a bit.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading2","text":"Why Trust The Spruce?","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"This article was edited and updated by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/marisa-casciano-5091570\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marisa Casciano</a>, who is the large appliance expert for The Spruce.
