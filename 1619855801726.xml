In northern states, the Red Maple usually grows in wet bottomland, river flood plains, and wet woods. In the midwest, it tends to grow in drier, rocky upland areas. It is very cold hardy in USDA Zones 3 through 9. Spreading 30 to 50 feet wide, it grows 40 to 70 feet tall with a rounded to oval crown. Red maples grow faster than Norway or sugar maples, but slower than silver maples. All emerging new growth in the form of leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit, and fall foliage are red or tinged with red. Flowers are typically red, sometimes yellow, in large clusters, blooming from March to April. After the flowers, come the leaves. The leaves start dark green above and gray green below. They are 2 to 5 inches long with 3 or 5 primary triangular-shaped, toothed, pointed lobes. Samara fruit is also initially reddish producing a two-winged samara.</p><p>Winged Elm (<em><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ten-species-of-elm-trees-3269656" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Ulmus</a> alata</em>) is another deciduous tree that gives way to samaras. This elm is native to southern Virginia west to Kentucky, southern Indiana and Illinois, and central Missouri; south to central Oklahoma and southeastern Texas; and east to central Florida. It also grows in Maryland. When placed in an open area, branches arch upward to create a rounded crown. In a forested site, the tree grows taller and straighter. Naturally, Winged Elm can be seen growing freely in rock outcrops, dry wooded areas, and fields. Bark is red-brown to ash gray. Leaves have doubly toothed margins. In fall, they turn yellow and in late winter, small red flowers mature in clusters. The tree produces 1/4- to 1/2-inch flattened samara with hairy margins. Other common names for the Winged Elm are Cork Elm, Small Leaf Elm, Wahoo Winged Elm, and Witch Elm. Prune this tree regularly to prevent it from growing multiple trunks.</p><p>Common hoptree (<em>Ptelea trifoliata</em>) is native to Eastern and central United States, hardy in Zones 4 through 9. This native, deciduous tree is sometimes considered a shrub because it grows a modest 15 to 20 feet tall and wide. The hoptree is dense and rounded, making it an ideal specimen for a flowering hedge. Naturally, it grows in open woods, glades, ravines, thickets, and prairies. Leaves are shiny, dark green, each two to five inches long, turning greenish yellow in autumn. Fragrant, tiny clusters of tiny greenish white flowers bloom in late spring. These clusters of flowers produce clusters of seeds, each seed encased in a thin, winged one-inch samara. Seeds mature in late summer and last through most of winter. The common name of hoptree refers to the prior use of seeds as a substitute for hops. Other common names include wafer ash and stinking ash.</p><h3>Light</h3><p>Grow Red Maple and Winged Elm in full sun to part shade. Hoptrees can tolerate full sun but thrive in part shade to full shade.</p><h3>Soil</h3><p>While Red Maple will tolerate a wide range of soils, it prefers moist, slightly acidic soil that is well-draining. Winged Elm prefers moist to dry conditions in a variety of soil types that contain loam, clay, sand, or rock. Hoptree will also grow in dry to medium well-drained conditions.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>Plant Red Maples in a rain garden or another site where it is easy to maintain a medium to wet environment. Give Winged Elms and Hoptrees dry to medium moisture.</p><h2>Are Samara Fruit Trees Toxic?</h2><p>Be sure to research each tree, shrub, or plant for their toxicity. Red Maple is toxic to horses, but non-toxic to dogs and cats, according to the ASPCA. Wilted leaves are the most toxic part of the plant. Symptoms of poisoning include "destruction of red blood cells (anemia), weakness, dark urine, difficulty breathing, abortion, [and] death."</p><p>Tree of Heaven leaves are toxic to domestic animals, according to Purdue University, which also cautions that gardeners may experience rashes from the leaves and hay fever from the plant's pollen. However, the hoptree and tulip tree are largely known as non-toxic.</p><h2>Harvesting Maple Seeds </h2><p>Maple seeds are more than a toy; they also have a pod with edible seeds inside. Remove the outer covering before eating the seeds from maple trees. When seeds are young and green in spring, they are known to be the most pleasant tasting. Sprinkle them into a salad or stir-fry or mix them into mashed potatoes. Since different varieties of maples produce samaras at different times of the year in certain areas, seeds might be available for harvest and consumption for an extended period. Store the seeds to continue eating them through summer, fall, and perhaps winter if you have enough to last a full year. Roast or boil them if mature seeds taste bitter.</p><h2>Common Pests and Diseases</h2><p>Aphids, borers, scale, and caterpillars are common pests to the Red Maple. Leafhoppers can cause the most substantial damage. Keep an eye out for verticillium wilt, canker, fungal leaf spot, and root rots. Branches are prone to breakage by wind and ice.</p><p>Borers, scale, and caterpillars may also attack the Winged Elm. Watch for beetles and leaf miners too. This tree is especially vulnerable to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/dutch-elm-disease-on-american-elm-trees-2131195" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Dutch Elm Disease</a>. Powdery mildew, phloem necrosis, cankers, and leaf spots can also cause issues on stressed trees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 7 Best Drill Presses of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/trJ5F48aBRwG7M-AlNnLRGfLgCY=/759x1500/715RIGooSGL._SL1500_-59ea5516845b340011e4144c.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[A good drill press is powerful, easy to control, and durable. We researched the features of the best models so you can pick the right ones for your projects.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drill presses are stationary tools–some stand on the floor while others sit on a workbench–with a sturdy and adjustable platform to hold the object being drilled, and an overhead chuck that holds the drill bit in place. Like a portable handheld drill, a drill press is a tool for making holes in wood or other hard materials, but drill presses go far beyond handheld drills in terms of power and precision.</p><p>A handheld drill is sufficient if you merely need to occasionally drill holes into wood for simple repairs or construction. But for drilling into very hard wood or metal, drilling through thick pieces of wood, producing large holes, drilling <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-drill-at-an-angle-1822332" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">at an angle</a>, or achieving the utmost in accuracy, a drill press is the tool of choice. We researched the top drill presses available today, and then whittled down the choices to those we feel are best in their categories.</p><p>Here are the best drill presses on the market.</p><p>It is all too easy to find the wrong drill press for your needs while shopping. Plenty of options promise the power you need for most construction projects but fail to deliver when needed. The WEN 12-Inch Variable Press, with a 12-inch swing and 3-1/8-inch stroke distance, is designed to skip the overselling and simply offers a powerful, <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-align-your-drill-press-3537091" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">straightforward drill press</a> for your shop. With a maximum speed of 3,200 rpm and variable speed dial, the power and control this top choice press offers ​is clear.</p><p>The benefit of a variable speed dial is you can change the speed while maintaining the same power and torque you may need for denser materials. Using high-quality bearings and a rigid frame, the body of this drill press will resist heavy abuse while extending the life of the inner workings of the power tool. If you need a drill press you can count on to work time and time again, this option is hard to beat.</p><p>If you just want a drill press for precision work on small items such as jewelry, shells, wood trim, or model making, there’s no need for a large tool that will take up lots of space and provide more muscle than you need. Instead, consider the Eurotool DRL-300.00 Small Benchtop Drill Press.</p><p>With a platform measuring a mere 6.75 inches x 6.75 inches, and an overall size of 10 x 12 x 8 inches, the drill press easily fits into any <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/workshop-storage-ideas-5079571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">workspace</a>. But while it may be small, it’s not without power, although it’s certainly not designed for tackling the toughest drilling jobs.</p><p>The 110-volt motor achieves a top speed of 8,500 rpm, and there are three speed settings to choose from. The <strong>¼</strong>-inch Jacobs chuck accepts bits up to 6.5 mm.</p><p>Not a true drill press, but rather, a workstation that allows you to use your Dremel rotary tool in a similar manner to a drill press, this workstation/drill press fits into the category of “small but mighty,” and is perfect for delicate tasks such as crafts, jewelry, or work on electronics. Your rotary tool fits into the workstation, allowing you to angle the tool at a variety of angles for your needs.</p><p>The workstation screws into a worktable for stability without taking up too much valuable space. Note, however, that it does not include the Dremel rotary tool; you'll need to purchase that separately if you don't already own one.</p><p>For the price, you actually get one of the most flexible drill presses available. The flex shaft attachment works with the drill to allow you to rotate the head for angled holes up to 90 degrees horizontal. A tool holder and router mount extend the capabilities of this press, enabling other work such as plunge routing and sanding/grinding to be done all in one workstation.</p><p>If you don’t mind giving up some performance and control out of a drill press, the WEN 4208 is a reasonably priced alternative that won’t break the bank. The press sacrifices the more flexible variable control dial for a five speed switch that extends all the way to 3,140 rpm. The 1/3-horsepower motor will get the job done on small to medium jobs and common construction materials, including <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/janka-wood-flooring-hardness-rating-chart-1821655" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">very hard woods</a>.</p><p>A cast iron base securely mounts to most worktables for a sturdy, stable hold. The included 6.5-inch x 6.5-inch beveling table is small but flexible, allowing you to tilt the drilling surface up to 45 degrees for angled drilling. This drill press has an 8-inch swing and a 2-inch stroke distance, meaning it's not designed to handle large, thick materials. The slots in the table are even large enough to accommodate mounting clamps and vises to secure the drilling surface to the table while tilting.</p><p>When it comes to drilling holes on the go, you probably think of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-use-a-power-drill-1825112" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">handheld power drills</a>. While these are the go-to choice for hobbyists and professionals alike, most power drills lack the precision some jobs require. When you need an additional guide, a lightweight option like the Ogrmar Drilling Collet Drill Press comes in handy. This ingenious device is far easier to transport than is an actual drill press.</p><p>Instead of forcing you to lug around a dedicated drill press, this tool allows you to secure your existing power drill into a tight, rotating clamp. This clamp holds the drill along the metal rail, giving you the finer degree of precision you need without the extra weight. The clamp rotates from 0 to 90 degrees, so you can even precision drill on vertical surfaces if you can place the press in the correct position.</p><p>A dedicated floor drill press offers the most in terms of professional capability and features. The Delta 18-900L is a top-of-the-line option that maximizes the power, control, and durability you can have out of a drill press. If you have a dedicated workshop or professional projects, this type of drill is an investment that will last you a long time.</p><p>Many professionals prefer floor drills since they don’t take up table space and, in fact, typically offer larger work surfaces underneath the drill. The 18-900L includes a 20 x 28 inch worktable that bevels up to 90 degrees left or right. The 6-inch drill stroke is ideal for industrial applications or projects where larger parts such as 4 x 4 wood beams are common. The extra stroke length means you can drill deeper without having to make additional holes on the other side to connect, and the 18-inch swing lets you tackle even very large materials.</p><p>Drilling through metal is a different experience than working with woods or plastics. Since metal densities vary, you need a drill press that is highly adaptable for different types of metal. The DEWALT DWE1622k Magnetic Drill Press specializes in drilling through steel or similar metals with a two-speed, 10-amp motor and 4-inch drill travel. Its magnetic base lets you position the tool on any ferrous material that's at least 1/2-inch thick. The maximum size bit the tool can accept is 2 inches in diameter.</p><p>The press has overload protection electronics that prevent motor burnout and extend the life of the tool. It includes a coolant tank that you can position as needed while you work. The lower speed setting revs up to 300 rpm, and the higher setting is up to 450 rpm, allowing you to easily penetrate even very hard metals. At 35 pounds, the drill press is fairly heavy, but it’s a sturdy, powerful tool.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Drill Press</h2><h3>Swing</h3><p>The swing of a drill press is the measurement in inches from the chuck—the clamp that holds the bit in place—to the column, which is the thick metal pole supporting the drill press head, multiplied by two. So if the measurement from your drill press’s chuck to column is 5 inches, then the drill press has a 10-inch swing. Swing tells you the largest piece of wood or metal the drill press can accommodate while drilling a hole right in the center. The larger the swing, the larger materials a drill press can handle, so keep this in mind if you regularly work with big pieces of wood or metal.</p><h3>Stroke Distance</h3><p>Also called spindle travel or quill travel, the stroke distance is a measurement of how deep a hole the drill press can create without having to stop and readjust the drill press table or the material being drilled. Smaller or less expensive drill presses often have a mere 2.5-inch stroke distance, sometimes even a little less. Large, heavy-duty floor-standing drill presses can have as much as 6 or more inches of stroke distance, but most hobbyists or general DIYers won’t require this level of performance. As a general rule, around 4 inches of spindle travel is more than sufficient for most typical tasks.</p><h3>Floor or Benchtop Design</h3><p>There are two basic styles of drill press: floor and benchtop.</p><p>As the name suggests, floor drill presses are large tools that stand on the floor. These have a lot of power and typically a swing between 13 and 20 inches. Floor-standing drill presses are best for professional or heavy-duty use.</p><p>Benchtop drill presses sit on a workbench. These smaller machines generally have a swing between 8 and 12 inches, and handle light-to-moderate drilling tasks. Generally, these are the best choice for the average DIYer or hobbyist.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What else can you use a drill press for besides drilling holes?</h3><p>While the primary use of a drill press is to drill holes—particularly large-bore holes or holes that don’t go all the way through the wood—the tool has other uses, as well. With the right bit or attachment, your drill press can also be used to sand or clean wood and metal, drill square holes, deburr wood or metal, and polish or buff wood or metal surfaces.</p><h3>Can I use the same bits in my drill press and handheld power drill?</h3><p>As a general rule, as long as the shank size of the bit is not larger than your drill press’s chuck—the most common chuck size for a typical benchtop drill press is ½-inch—you can use the same bits with your drill press as you do with your corded or cordless power drill. Drill presses can handle larger diameter bits than the average power drill, however, which is one of the main benefits of these powerful tools.</p><h3>Is there any way to use a regular drill in place of a drill press?</h3><p>If you only need the precision of a drill press for one particular project, you might not want to invest in an entire tool just for that purpose. You can achieve similar results, however, as long as you don’t plan on drilling very large holes or into an exceptionally hard material, by using a frame designed to hold a corded or cordless drill in place as you use it. These frames rotate so you can position the drill just as you need it, and hold it far stiller during use than you’d be able to manage with your hand alone.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/michelle-ullman-350447" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Michelle Ullman</a>, the tool expert for The Spruce.

<description><![CDATA[There are two main types of vacuums—upright and canister—they vary based on maneuverability and ease of use. We researched the top vacuum options for you.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upright vacuums and their canister counterparts are some of the most common and popular varieties of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/dont-mistreat-vacuum-cleaner-1901204" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">vacuum cleaners</a> on the market. And it's easy to see why: Where the former tend to be workhorses with plenty of versatile attachments, the latter are nimble, lighter weight, and easy to use all around the house.</p><p>Both types are so enticing that it can be difficult to decide which one is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-buying-guide-1909001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">right for you</a> and your cleaning needs. That's why we've rounded up the best upright and canister vacuums all in one place—read on to learn more about our top picks and to find out which one is right for your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/right-way-to-vacuum-your-carpet-2908791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning needs</a> and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/new-vacuum-cleaner-cost-1901196" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>.</p><p>Here, the best canister and upright vacuums available on the market.</p><p>This surprisingly lightweight vacuum from Shark exemplifies so much of what we love about upright vacuums. It features powerful suction, multi-surface cleaning, a hefty dust cup, and anti-allergen technology. Its swivel steering makes it easy to maneuver around the house and clean tight corners. Its LED headlights reveal overlooked debris. But this model does more than check the essential boxes.</p><p>This vacuum is actually a two-for-one deal: In addition to its regular upright mode, the main pod lifts away for handheld use on stairs, in hard-to-reach places, or on high-up fixtures like drapes. The crevice tool and upholstery brush attachments clean where neither the upright nor the pod can reach. In sum, if you want to clean your home's floors, furniture, and stairs with one high-quality machine, this Shark upright vacuum should be your pick.</p><p>When it comes to both power and quality, Miele’s Compact C1 Pure Suction vacuum cleaner has all the essentials to tackle carpeting and smooth flooring alike. Switch seamlessly between these surfaces with the push of a switch to experience the power of the robust Vortex Motor System in action. Combined with a powerful, six setting motor, and you’re guaranteed an unmatched clean compared to other models.</p><p>Intimidated by the strong suctioning and cleaning qualities? There's no need to be! The 13.8 pound wand moves effortlessly around an impressive cleaning radius of up to 29.5 inches. While doing so, it captures up to 99.9 percent of all air particles, so you can ensure your cleaning spree is a safe one.</p><p>The strong suctioning qualities and lightweight make-up are overall impressive, while the quiet operation makes it a great choice for families with small children or for those who live in a small apartment. After a few uses, it will become evident why this little “work horse” is an overall favorite.</p><p>This upright model from Bissell proves that you don't have to sacrifice quality while saving money on a vacuum. With powerful suction, five height settings, dual-edge cleaning, and multi-level filtration, this vacuum cleans better on the first pass than models of similar prices do after multiple turns around room. The 25-foot power cord, and scatter-proof brush bar makes this machine all the more efficient.</p><p>The Bissell CleanView Plus comes with a crevice tool, dusting brush, extension wand, and TurboBrush (which is especially good for cleaning carpets and upholstery). For such a heavy duty machine, it's lightweight and handles easily. If you're cleaning on a budget, this is simply the best upright vacuum for your money.</p><p>This Bissell canister vacuum can switch from cleaning carpets to hard floors on a dime, reaches inaccessible nooks and crannies around the house, and seals dirt and debris into its 2.5 liter dust bag. You can adjust the suction to fit your current cleanup job and enjoy hassle-free storage thanks its automatically rewinding power cord.</p><p>This model can clean high and low with its telescoping wand and, at only 7.5 pounds, it won't give your arms too much of a workout. This is a wonderful, wallet-friendly option for anyone who wants a nimble little vacuum that can handle small cleanups and major messes alike.</p><p>This vacuum features some of the most innovative technology on the market at the moment, including a dual-action roller for far-reaching, consistent suction and self-cleaning brushroll that resists even the most matted messes of pet hair. The Vertex deeply cleans carpets of dust, dander, and other allergens, trapping them away in a sealed HEPA filtration system. The only way dirt gets out of this vacuum is by way of its one-button emptying feature.</p><p>The attachable pet power brush and crevice tool come in handy when cleaning upholster and hard-to-reach areas. Weighing slightly over 16 pounds, this model is undeniably on the heavier side, but the lift-away pod allows for a lighter-weight cleaning experience, for when you need to clean under furniture or above the floor. The 30-foot power cord lets you coast around an entire room without having to relocate the plug. Finally, with its sleek design and rose gold finish, this vacuum matches its performance with its looks.</p><p>Dyson received the highest score among canister vacuums in the <em>J.D. Power 2017 Vacuum Satisfaction Studies</em>, so it’s no surprise that their model, the Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Canister Vacuum, gets our vote in the Best High End Canister category. With the ability to clean any floor without frequent canister emptying, this sleek choice is an effective option for your home. This vacuum promises to never lose its suction, and, unlike many other models, there's no need to wash or replace a filter. While it operates, the head sucks up dirt in tricky to navigate spots. When it does meet its .42 gallon capacity, you can eject the contents with the simple tap of a button.</p><p>While the initial price upfront is steep, Dyson includes includes a five-year protection plan, so no additional warranty is needed. And, frankly, its enduring performance make it an undeniably solid investment.</p><p>The key to completely clean hardwood floors is a vacuum that doesn't have a coarse brushroll. While this feature is a perk when dredging up debris from high-pile carpet, it will only get in the way (and even put your floors at risk of getting damaged) when cleaning harder surfaces. Luckily, this upright vacuum from Shark features a brushroll that can be raised or lowered, depending on the type of floor you're currently cleaning.</p><p>In addition to its hardwood-friendly brushroll, the Shark Navigator's pet power brush and crevice attachments can pick up dirt, dust, and pet dander with ease, while its lift-away pod makes it easy to clean staircases. If your home is mostly hardwood—but also plagued by everyday messes on upholstery and in hard-to-reach areas—this vacuum is versatile enough to meet all your cleaning needs.</p><p>Don't let its overall cleaning power fool you—this canister vacuum is surprisingly gentle on hardwood surfaces. That's thanks, in part, to its adjustable suction controls (which you can access from the wand's handle), but its smaller design details, like the rubber wheels with felt treads, also keep hard floors clean and scratch-free.</p><p>If your home's floors are a mix of hardwood and carpet, this canister model is great option for your cleaning needs. In addition to its hardwood-compatible floorhead, it comes with another floor attachment made specifically for low-pile carpets. For multi-surface cleanups, the Bissell Hard Floor Expert Deluxe Canister Vacuum will certainly get the job done.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Upright or Canister Vacuum</h2><h3>Maneuverability</h3><p>When shopping for an upright or canister vacuum, consider how easy it'll be to move it from room to room. While upright vacuums glide on built-in wheels and pack a little more suction power, you'll have more weight to push around. Canister vacuums, on the other hand, are lighter, but you might need to carry them since not all models have wheels. Canister vacuums are also usually equipped with longer hoses and wand attachments to reach high, dusty spots like shelves, drapes, and more. </p><h3>Dust and debris collection</h3><p>All the dust and debris you suction up through the vacuum cleaner must go somewhere, so you’ll need to decide whether you want a bagged or bagless model. Both upright and canister vacuums options are available with conventional vacuum cleaner bags, but it should be noted that the trend is towards bagless vacuum cleaners with dust cups that can be emptied and don’t need frequent replacement. While vacuum bags seal in dust and dirt better, it's an extra recurring expense you’ll need to consider.</p><h3>Filtration</h3><p>Just about all vacuums have some type of dust filtration, but if you’re looking for enhanced dust, dander, and allergen filtration, consider a vacuum with specialized filtration. Onboard HEPA filters will trap particles as small as 0.03 microns in size, and some models pair these filters with carbon filters for extra odor and dust control. Some filters are washable, while others will need to be replaced on an ongoing basis for long-term effectiveness.</p><h2>FAQS</h2><h3>When should I choose a canister vacuum over an upright model?</h3><p>If you plant to use your vacuum on multiple levels of your home, or if you live in an apartment or smaller space, you may be better off choosing a canister over an upright vacuum. Canister vacuums are generally lighter and easier to maneuver from room to room (or from floor to floor), and can reach above-floor areas with more easily than uprights. This makes them extremely versatile cleaning machines that, as long as you don't have high-pile carpets or large rooms to clean, can vacuum your whole home without issues.</p><h3>When should I choose an upright vacuum over a canister model?</h3><p>If you're looking for a vacuum with maximum suction power, an upright is the right model for you. This type of vacuum is considered the workhorse of the vacuum family for a reason—upright vacuums are sturdy, usually hold more dirt than other vacuum varieties, and can clean rugs as effectively as bare floors. Homes with carpeted rooms will benefit immensely from an upright vacuum. This model is also a great pick for homes with limited storage space, as it tends to have a smaller footprint than canister vacuums.</p><h3>What kind of suction power can I expect from upright and canister vacuums?</h3><p>As mentioned above, an upright vacuum will more than likely have stronger suction than a canister. However, you can find plenty of suction power in both varieties. To get a better idea of your vacuum's suction, take note of how many interior fans it features, the size of its motor, and what it promises in terms of airflow.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

<title>The 9 Best Shark Vacuums of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/V1CLdCvS9jlbqAvqYfBEdGPMb8k=/1500x1000/shark-navigator-a5887e92c9bb4b2a9c478115d7230433.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[Shark is one of the most well-known brands when it comes to household cleaning machines. We researched and tested their best-selling models to find the best one.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's a reason why Shark brand vacuum cleaners make frequent appearances on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-reviews-4690216" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spruce's best lists</a>—with their dependable suction and performance, intentional designs, and ease of use, they're some of the most accessible and satisfying vacuums on the market. If you happen to be a Shark loyalist, we can hardly blame you.</p><p>Of course, the selection of Shark vacuums to choose from is only getting wider. And if you aren't totally sure which one is the right choice for your household (and the kind of messes it tends to accumulate), it's easy to feel overwhelmed. That's why we've pored over the current options at Shark and selected our favorites in nine different categories. Whether you want a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-features-1901184" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">powerhouse</a> that handles <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/clean-area-rug-on-hardwood-4799149" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">all surfaces</a> or a nimble stick vacuum to tackle <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/clean-your-living-room-in-15-minutes-1976385" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick clean-ups</a>, there's a Shark out there for you.</p><p>Here, find our picks for Shark's best vacuum cleaners.</p><p>When it comes to getting a clean home, the Shark Navigator Professional NV356E is our top choice. With lift-away technology and a brushroll shutoff, this is a practical choice for hardwood floors or any solid surface floor cleaning, as well as carpets.</p><p>The Shark Navigator NV356E has a bristle brush that will agitate carpet fibers to remove deep-seated dirt but can be deactivated to protect hardwood floors from scratches and wear. But what really sets apart this Shark vacuum for hardwood floors is the included Dust-Away attachment with a microfiber pad. When using the Lift-Away vacuum in canister mode, simply attach the Dust Away tool, which is essentially a large microfiber pad that will pick up fine dirt and dust from hardwoods, tiles, and more. People that have actually used the Dust-Away attachment say that combining suction with the microfiber pad means the vacuum will suck up larger items in its path while sweeping up dust and fine particles with the pad’s surface.</p><p>The biggest complaint about the Shark Navigator Professional NV356E is that the floorhead isn’t as wide as some other models. The cleaning path is only 9.5 inches wide. However, the dust cup is an impressive 2.2 dry quarts so you won’t need to make frequent trips to empty this vacuum during cleaning sessions.</p><p>If you have pets, you likely have an ongoing battle to keep fur and dander under control. The Shark Rotator TruePet NV752 is a popular choice when shopping for a Shark vacuum for pets.</p><p>Built on the popular Rotator model upright vacuum that many love for its deep cleaning and lift-away functionality, the TruePet model from Shark incorporates a motorized brush and pet multi-tool. The result is a powerful vacuum with sustained suction that can be used to eliminate pet hair buried deep in carpets, stuck between seat cushions, or clinging to drapes.</p><p>Instead of sticking a flimsy attachment on the vacuum’s hose and hoping that you’ll be able to suction the pet hair stuck to your sofa, the Rotator True Pet allows you to attach a motorized brush to the hose and take the lift-away canister with you wherever pet hair lurks. Conquer those pet fuzzies under the bed or on your favorite chair with high-powered bristle action and powerful suction.</p><p>In addition, pet owners and allergy sufferers alike will appreciate the fact that this model of Shark vacuum also features a sealed air system and a HEPA filter to trap up to 99.9 percent of allergens. People that have used the Shark NV752 say that it’s definitely the way to go for pet-friendly homes and rave about the agitation and power of the motorized brush in comparison to other vacuums for pet hair that use turbine technology or suction alone to remove fur.</p><p>With this advanced model, Shark has outdone itself: The self-cleaning brushroll is an improved version of previous designs, made to pick up even more pet hair with a single pass without the risk of hair wrap. The DuoClean system features silicone fins that maintain constant contact with the floor (even when transitioning from carpets to hard wood) and a soft roller that pulls in small and large debris to a more efficient extent than the original iteration of Shark's DuoClean technology. The LED-lit nozzle makes it easy to see exactly where to go to get every last bit of dirt and the 30-foot cord is long enough that you can coast across a room without having to move where you're plugged in.</p><p>The dusting brush, pet crevice tool, and self-cleaning pet power brush handle messes in small spaces and on furniture—and the HEPA filter and anti-allergen complete seal ensures that the dust and dander that they bring in stay trapped. The lift away pod, meanwhile, allows you to clean high up or under furniture without worrying about lugging the whole vacuum along with you (which, at 16 pounds, is on the heavier side).</p><p>In short, this model melds what you love about Shark vacuums with minor—but meaningful—upgrades, making it well worth its price.</p><p>If you’re looking for a technologically advanced vacuum cleaner with powerful suction, we recommend the Shark Apex Upright Vacuum. It will not only clean your room, but it will also clean itself! Armed with a self-cleaning brushroll for nonstop hair removal, this vacuum is one of the most efficient products Shark has to offer. </p><p>The Apex is easy to assemble and features Shark DuoClean, Powered Lift-Away, and Zero-M technologies. In addition to its advanced design, this product sports a detachable canister that extends the reach of the cleaner head, making hard-to-reach messes a thing of the past. The Apex’s quiet sound design and performance on various surfaces—hardwood floors, carpet, even upholstered furniture—makes it suitable for cleaning just about any room of the house. Furthermore, the product’s advanced anti-allergen complete seal technology and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/do-i-need-a-hepa-filter-1901189" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEPA filter</a> add to its overall efficiency.</p><p>If you want to vacuum without wrangling a cord, a battery-operated model is the best choice for you. Perfect for quick pick-ups or small spaces, the Shark Freestyle Cordless Stick Vacuum is a nimble, cost-effective choice.</p><p>The Freestyle is powered by a rechargeable battery that offers run times up to about 20 minutes, based on whether you are running it on high or low power. Note that this isn’t a lithium-ion battery, which makes this Shark vacuum lag slightly behind the competition in the cordless vacuum segment. However, it is affordable and the charging station is integrated into a handy storage dock for the vacuum.</p><p>This cordless vacuum by Shark might struggle to pick up cereal or larger debris. Even still, this vacuum makes it so much easier to vacuum high-traffic areas frequently or keep up in between deep cleaning sessions. If you’re looking for a light-duty vacuum with no cord hassle from Shark, the Freestyle Cordless Stick Vacuum fits the bill.</p><p>Stick vacuums are a great buy for any busy household. They do a solid job at cleaning up everyday messes without the need of lugging out the big guns. While cordless options can seem like a smart purchase—they often have a short battery life which can leave you high and dry when you need it.</p><p>This new model has the ability to clean floors but it can also be broken down into a handheld version to tackle stairs, furniture, upholstery, and such. The best feature of this stick vacuum is the self-cleaning brushroll technology that eliminates the need to physically remove wrapped around hairs.</p><p>Conquer carpet with a Shark vacuum that is up to the task, thanks to powerful suction and a deep agitating brushroll. The Shark Rotator Professional NV501 is a popular choice among people that have carpeted surfaces to clean and want the versatility and convenience of a Shark vacuum.</p><p>Equipped with a wider floorhead than the Navigator line of vacuums, the Rotator Professional will give you a wider cleaning path—which means less effort on your part to clean the floors. The advanced swivel steering built into the Rotator Professional vacuums makes it easier to maneuver, which is a plus since this vacuum weighs 15.5 pounds.</p><p>Under the floorhead is the key to the Rotator’s carpet cleaning abilities. Plenty of suction power combines with a bristled brush to extract dirt and debris from its hiding place in your carpeting and area rugs. This model of Shark vacuum is the perfect partner in marathon vacuuming sessions, thanks to its strong suction and impressive cord length.</p><p>This stick vacuum is a corded model—meaning you will have to plug it in for operation. However, you don’t have to worry about charging batteries and finishing the job before the juice runs out. This vacuum is super lightweight and weighs only 7.6 pounds. The detachable hand vacuum weighs only 4.6 pounds and is perfect for tackling small jobs and tight spaces—like under the couch cushions or the seats of your car.</p><p>The Rocket also comes with a crevice tool, upholstery tool, dusting brush, and a Hard Floor Hero—which is perfect for use on solid flooring that needs a touch-up. There is only room to attach two of the three smaller attachments (crevice tool, upholstery tool, and dust brush), which can be an inconvenience if you think you’ll misplace the loose attachment. One other thing to note is that this 2-in-1 model of Shark vacuum has a rather small dust cup at just .42 dry quarts.</p><p>This is a great Shark vacuum to consider if you are debating between a Shark hand vac and stick vacuum. With the Shark Rocket DuoClean, you’ll have easy access to a larger corded stick vacuum for cleaning more square footage along with the convenience of a smaller hand vacuum for quick jobs.</p><p>This robotic model makes whole-home cleaning about as hands-off as it can get. Featuring home mapping technology, customizable room selection, a base for self-emptying, and the option to enable voice control through Amazon Alexa, the Shark IQ Self-Empty XL handles the grunt work of vacuuming easily and efficiently. If its battery gets low in the middle of a job, it will return to its charging base and resume cleaning after refueling.</p><p>For all its tech-savvy capabilities, this vacuum doesn't skimp on pure cleaning power. The self-cleaning brushroll is designed to remove pet hair without tangling and the suction is powerful enough to extract debris of all sizes across floor surfaces. Plus, the spinning side brushes make sure even tight corners and spaces under cabinets get cleaned.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Shark Vacuum</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>From full-sized vacuums to stick and handheld versions, there’s a Shark vacuum to get any job done. The question is what kind of job do you want to get done most often. The size of your home, as well as the types of flooring you have, should drive your choices. </p><h3>Feel</h3><p>Shark vacuums come in various weights and with varying capabilities. While heavier models may do more heavy-duty cleaning, if you’re going to have to haul a vacuum up and down stairs frequently, then you may want to consider lighter models. Also, consider how easy one is to maneuver, particularly if you want to get into tight spots and corners. </p><h3>Features</h3><p>Do you want a cordless vacuum? One that also has a light so you can see in the dark spots? Or perhaps you want one that means you never have to remove those wrapped-around hairs from the vacuum's brushes? Shark makes models with all these features and more. The type of flooring you have as well as how often you use your vacuum should dictate your choices.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I clean a Shark vacuum?</h3><p>You'll need to refer to your model's manual to know exactly how to clean it. But, in general, you should empty the dust cup into the trash, using the model's bottom release button, then wipe out the vacuum's interior with a dry microfiber cloth.</p><h3>How do I clean a Shark vacuum filter?</h3><p>Most Shark vacuums have reusable filters that you can rinse under water (without soap). They'll need at 24 hours to air dry completely, after which you can reinstall them. You'll know the filters are due for a cleaning when the vacuum's airflow or suction decreases. All that said, read your Shark vacuum's manual beforehand, to make sure your particular model has a rinsable filter.</p><h3>How long do Shark vacuums last?</h3><p>Shark products purchased from authorized retailers come with a <a href="https://www.sharkclean.com/warranty/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">warranty</a> ranging from one to seven years, which covers repairs and replacements for defective parts. Taking advantage of this warranty will help keep your model in shape for longer. More generally, you can expect your vacuum to last for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lifespan-of-small-appliances-4169933" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">about eight years</a>, depending on how much you use it and what you do to maintain its performance.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

<description><![CDATA[Follow these tips from the Houseplant Guru, Lisa Eldred Steinkop, to get your houseplants ready to live outdoors for the summer.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/3hGEor-fwWoftEiF3_AuvCkfYJc=/2121x1414/GettyImages-482987325-ba00f5f5b6204d31a18323add00de9a0.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="plants on back porch steps" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Copit / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>As we near the last frost date for most of the U.S., it's time to start the annual houseplant migration. Like many houseplant parents, I like to move my tropicals outdoors to enjoy the extra light, air and humidity. However, it's not as simple as just popping them outside when it's warm enough. Lisa Eldred Steinkop, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Houseplant-Party-projects-growing-indoor/dp/163159883X/" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Houseplant Party</a> and founder of <a href="https://thehouseplantguru.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">The Houseplant Guru</a>, shares her expert tips on how to get your houseplants ready to go outdoors.</p><h2>Wait Until After the Last Frost Date</h2><p>I live in the deep south. We have days during the winter when you get spring-like temperatures. Sometimes, it gets tempting to throw caution to the wind and put the houseplants outdoors before the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/first-and-last-frost-date-2539701" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">last frost date</a>. Don't do it—they are tropical species. Even early spring temperatures may be too cold for their liking. When in doubt, wait until the overnight temperatures are well into the upper 50s or 60s, and there is no chance for a surprise frost or freeze.</p><h2>Repot</h2><p>"If you are moving them out for the summer, you may want to up-pot them into larger pots if they need it before moving outside or right when you do so the mess is outside," suggests Steinkop, "Especially if they are rootbound because they usually need more water outside and rootbound plants would need even more."</p><p>Believe it or not, your potted plants still grew while indoors, and you probably didn't repot them during the growing season. Spring is the perfect time to refresh the soil and give them a nice new roomy pot to grow in.</p><h2>Getting the Plants Acclimated</h2><p>"Plants inside do not have as much protection on their leaves as they do when they are outside, says Steinkop, "They don't need it because they are trying to gather as much light as they can in our lower light homes." Consequently, an indoor plant needs to build up a thicker layer (cuticle) on their leaves before sun exposure, so they do not get a sunburn (yes, plants can get burned). "That is why plants should never be taken outside and immediately plopped in the sun," warns Steinkop.</p><p>How do you acclimate plants? "Put them on the north side of the house in the shade or under a tree for a couple of weeks to get it used to being outside," Steinkop explains, "Then move it gradually into the sun," She says it's comparable to going to the tanning booth a few times before you head to the beach so you don't get a sunburn from the sudden, intense exposure to the sun.</p><p>Also, protect them from the wind because the plants are not used to air movement, and the wind could stress them out and even damage them. "This acclimation process pertains to all plants, including <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cacti-and-succulents-5092671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">cacti and other succulents</a>," says Steinkop.</p><h2>Not All Houseplants Should Summer Outdoors</h2><p>Not all plants take well to the change in environment, even when you do it gradually. The most significant stressor is sunburn. "If they are not acclimated, they will sunburn, and with thinner leaved plants, it may be shocking enough to kill them," explains Steinkop.</p><p>Sunburned plants will wilt excessively or develop brown patches on their leaves. Research your plant before placing it outside to make sure you truly understand its light needs. Ambient light in a shaded outdoor environment is much brighter than many indoor areas.</p><p>"Some plants would rather not be in the full sun outside," says Steinkop. "High light plants are fine, but if you have a medium to low-light plant, such as an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-cast-iron-plants-aspidistra-1902740" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspidistra</a>, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-growing-fern-plants-1402823" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">fern</a>, or aglaonema, they will prefer to be in a shaded spot outside. Make sure the final location you want to place them out is a safe place for them."</p><h2>Prevent Hitchhikers</h2><p>Being outdoors means there's a chance for insects and other pests to reside in your potted plants. To help limit the chance for hitchhikers, use risers underneath your plants, so they do not sit directly on the ground. "This keeps the drainage hole off the ground and not only helps with drainage but will help keep insects, worms, centipedes and mollusks (roly polies) out of your plants," explains Steinkop.</p><h2>Check Moisture Levels Daily</h2><p>Potted plants in the outdoors will dry out faster. "Remember outside there is wind and more light, so your plants will need to be watered more often," says Steinkop, "Check them daily to see if they need water."</p><p>Plants in unglazed pots, like terra cotta, may even require watering every day. Remember to water thoroughly every time to ensure adequate moisture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 6 Best Patio Dining Sets of 2021</title>

<description><![CDATA[The perfect dining set for your patio should be stylish, durable, and comfortable. We researched the best options in a range of styles and price points.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you live somewhere that's warm all year round or you just want to take advantage of sunny days when you can get them, an outdoor space is a coveted commodity. Turning it into a true oasis requires the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/buying-furniture-1391734" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">right furniture</a>, especially if you plan on using your space for eating or entertaining. Choosing a patio dining set is fun if not a little daunting, as there are a wide range of options out there depending on the size and look you're going for.</p><p>Here, we rounded up the best patio dining sets for every budget and style.</p><p>Your outdoor space is your personal sanctuary, so it's understandable if you want to invest a bit in certain pieces to make it just right. Take this Frontgate set, which balances style and function for a gorgeous outdoor dining setup.</p><p>The seven-piece set includes six chairs and a dining table, so you can sit with multiple guests comfortably. Each chair is crafted of lightweight, powder-coated aluminum and features teak insets on each armrest for an elevated look. The chairs' crisp, white cushions—which are optional—are easy to clean, so you won't have to worry about any stains or spills. The set is complete with the dining table, which features a teak top situated on a powder-coated aluminum base.</p><p>Though this set is certainly a splurge, Frontgate offers a 10-year structural warranty on all outdoor aluminum, teak, and wicker furniture frames, as well as a two-year warranty on cushion fabrics, so you can feel confident in your purchase.</p><p>Patio dining sets are no small purchase. If you're looking for something that can seat four or more people, most options will start in the $500 range. If that's out of the question for you, that doesn't mean you can't find something—just check out the ASKHOLMEN Table and Chair Set from IKEA.</p><p>The budget-friendly set is constructed from durable, sustainably sourced acacia, and you can choose from two wood finishes and an assortment of cushion colors. The 45 x 34.75 x 30-inch patio table can fit four adults comfortably, and if you want to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-easily-organize-a-garage-2648059" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">stow the set in a garage</a> or shed once you're done, every piece folds up flat.</p><p>Though cast iron has long been popular in outdoor spaces, in recent years cast aluminum has jumped in popularity amongst people looking for new metal furniture. Why? Because cast aluminum is just as durable, lighter weight, and less expensive than cast iron.</p><p>This five-piece set melds the best of new and old. With its curved arms and legs and latticework pattern, the design nods to more ornate, traditional cast iron styles and would fit in perfectly on a patio alongside traditional cast iron pieces.</p><p>There’s a reason families love sitting at picnic tables in the park: Those long, narrow benches are a flexible-seating secret because they can accommodate quite a few people for a cozy, casual meal. A bench can easily seat four of five squirming children, but won’t seem empty with just two people sitting upon it, and can take up way less space than four or five adult-size chairs. Benches are also a good space-saving option since they aren’t typically as deep as chairs and don’t have backs to worry about.</p><p>This bench dining set from Christopher Knight Home is an elevated take on the traditional picnic table with wooden seats and a metal base. It'll look right at home in industrial, modern, and rustic spaces, and gives you plenty of flexibility to play around with colorful throw pillows and decor.</p><p>If your outdoor space is limited or you're working with a balcony as opposed to an actual backyard, Hashtag Home's Ainsley 3-Piece Bistro Set will definitely come in handy. The table is large enough to accommodate a few dishes if you're looking to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/outdoor-seating-ideas-4691734" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">dine al fresco</a>, but at the same time, its small 28 x 23 x 23-inch frame can fit almost anywhere.</p><p>If you're looking for a low-maintenance set, this is a great pick. The two chairs feature slats that allow rain to run through them, rather than pool, so you won't have to deal with mold or mildew. The chairs also fold down, so they're easy to store in a garage or shed when not in use. The Hashtag Home set is available in four fun colors: white, black, navy, and red.</p><p>Bar height dining sets, where the table and chairs are elevated above the typical dining set, are an increasingly popular option, and for good reason: They work for both intimate dinners and entertaining. With the elevated height, it’s comfortable to stand at the table in addition to sitting, so friendly groups can squeeze in for a conversation. Plus, they have a more casual vibe that's perfect for outdoor areas.</p><p>This 5-piece set from AllModern includes four chairs and a table, all of which have sturdy aluminum frames and slatted resin tops that are both UV- and mildew-resistant. If you're worried about the extra height making storage difficult, fear not: The chairs are stackable and easy to take care of during the off-season.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Patio Dining Set</h2><h3>Size</h3><p>Finding the right-sized pieces to fit your space is probably the biggest challenge when selecting patio furniture. You want your set to be roomy enough to be comfortable for your family and friends, but not so big that it overwhelms your space. Make sure to measure carefully, incorporating enough room for people to back chairs out and walk around.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>Patio furniture comes in a variety of styles, from sleek and modern to homey and rustic and everything in between. Patio furniture should complement your home’s style and any existing outdoor furniture and landscaping, but if you plan to use it frequently and not just look at it, make sure it’s comfortable and functional. </p><h3>Material </h3><p>A patio set's material needs to be compatible with its surrounding space and climate. If your patio furniture will live in an enclosed location or will have plenty of shelter, you may not have to be as selective as you would if your furniture will be in the direct path of the sun, rain, and other elements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 5 Best Beach Chairs of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/DTyrv0lUSbIjYcAVMzlz9Zr2q6o=/2123x1413/GettyImages-622570078-f4c4b259d452463fb8394b6924109bf0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[Beach chairs can provide a variety of features to help you relax outside. We researched the best beach chairs so you can find the right one.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s nothing quite like a relaxing day on the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/beach-house-living-room-ideas-4126589" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">beach</a>, but there’s nothing serene about getting sand, well, everywhere. To keep yourself a little cleaner and a little more comfortable on your day off, you’ll need a quality beach chair. These lightweight outdoor chairs give you a little lift up and offer both back and head support, plus often come with handy extras like cup holders, pockets, and even a place to safely stash your phone or e-reader. Ready for some fun in the sun?</p><p>Here, the best beach chairs available online.</p><p>There’s no doubt about it: The best beach chair is one that marries both form and function, and this one by RIO doesn’t disappoint. At just eight pounds, the lightweight and rust-proof aluminum frame is far easier to carry than most other beach chairs that tip the scales somewhere between 15 and 20 pounds. The chair also has a very practical flexible suspension design meant to conform to your body to offer the very best in support. Both of these features alone make the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/outdoor-chair-plans-4690705" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">chair</a> a great option for anyone, but particularly older adults who can’t lug a hefty chair, but require more support than your standard chair offers.</p><p>There are plenty of additional comfort features here, too. The chair has a four-position recline, as well as an adjustable pillow. What’s more, you’ll find a large storage pouch on the back for all of your essentials, plus a cup holder to keep your beverage of choice handy and free from sand. There’s no need to worry about portability, either. When folded, the chair features padded, adjustable straps to make backpack-style transport a breeze.</p><p>When it comes to beach chairs, you can be sure Tommy Bahama is going to deliver. The brand was among the first to produce backpack-style chairs, and they’ve truly perfected them. How so? When folded as a backpack, this seven-pound chair is not only easy to carry (thank you, padded and adjustable straps!), but it also functions as, well, a backpack. On the exterior, you’ll find two pockets—one mesh one for gear (think a towel, a wet bathing suit, or even your wallet) and one insulated cooler-style bag for your lunch or beverage of choice. </p><p>This chair delivers in the area of comfort, too. The place to perch easily adjusts to five different seating positions, including a lay-flat option, plus a contoured headrest.</p><p>Though technically a camping chair, you can rely on YETI to make a perch suitable for all kinds of outdoor adventures, including the beach. Like all things YETI makes, this chair is extra durable, making it the perfect choice for someone who thinks your typical beach chair is just a little too flimsy. Of course, YETI also excels at creating fantastic beverage accessories, like mugs and coolers, so you can count on this tough-as-nails chair to have an equally reliable cup holder. It isn’t your typical flimsy pocket; it’s a hard-sided cup holder that stays upright even when the chair is folded. The two-tiered cup is just the right size for whatever beverage you prefer, be it cans, longnecks, or even YETI brand vessels like Ramblers, the Colster, wine tumblers, and more.</p><p>When it comes to children’s beach chairs, you really can’t beat this option. Though it may not have the visual appeal of the classic beach chair, it’s so much more functional—plus, it’s suitable for a wide range of other outdoor adventures, from <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/camping-activities-with-the-family-1270679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">camping</a> to sporting events.</p><p>Though the chair is a bit of investment compared to the aforementioned classic models, it’s worth it. The chair will grow with your child until they’re ready for an adult beach chair since it’s suitable for babies as young as three months and kids weighing up to 75 pounds. While your little one is still young, the five-point removable harness keeps them nice and secure. Then, as your child grows, the seat morphs to reveal two leg holes perfect for letting baby stand with support. Once your child is a bit bigger, convert the chair back into a regular seat—sans harness. </p><p>Additional included features include a removable snack tray for bites and meals on the go, a sun canopy for extra protection, and a carry bag to make transport a breeze.</p><p>If you really want to maximize your beach day as a day of relaxation and TLC, you may want to opt for this chair, as it can easily be converted into a seat that more closely resembles a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/small-pools-big-style-4177842" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">pool</a> lounger. </p><p>The chair, which sits a comfortable 12 inches off the ground (not too high and not too low), features five adjustable chair positions and three adjustable footrest positions—including one that combines to let you lay flat. For sunbathers, the unique patented design will be what ultimately wins you over: The headrest opens to a face cavity, and the side slits of the chair function as arm slots, so you can comfortably lay flat even when on your stomach.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Beach Chair</h2><h3>Price</h3><p>Prices range pretty drastically. In most cases, the cheapest chairs are relatively flimsy and lack extras. That said, there’s really no need to spend at the high end to get a quality beach chair. There are plenty of truly outstanding options right around the $50 mark. </p><h3><br>Portability</h3><p>Today, many beach chairs come with some sort of strap to make carrying easier (no more stuffing a bulky chair under your arm along with all of your other beach supplies!). That said, not all are created equal. The most basic straps are canvas shoulder straps that hang down under the seat of the chair when in use. The more comfortable straps, though, are backpack-style straps that are padded and can be easily adjusted for proper fit. </p><h3><br>Extra features</h3><p>You may want to consider whether or not the beach chair you’re selecting has helpful added features that improve functionality. This includes things like multi-position recline, cup holders, sun canopies, storage pockets, and even insulated coolers.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/brigitt-earley-4174127" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Brigitt Earley</a>, a freelance writer who has spent the last 10-plus years researching the best home goods for various digital publications, including The Spruce and Good Housekeeping. From beach chairs and outdoor tables to throw pillows and space heaters, she’s covered it all. You won’t catch Brigitt at the beach without a Tommy Bahama beach chair.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 8 Best Cheap Vacuum Cleaners of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Z6s6ba_vz0bDwBLGeeAjFKlVfCU=/5700x3801/woman-vacuuming-small-shelves-562452139-59fc75d5482c52001a02d911.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[The best cheap vacuums cleaners should be affordable and efficient. We researched the different features of budget vacuum models that can get the job done well.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/save-money-on-housekeeping-costs-4081770" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>, life situation, or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/way-to-save-money-cleaning-1900935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning routine</a> doesn’t warrant spending hundreds of dollars on a vacuum cleaner, don’t worry, you can still find a model that will keep your space <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/way-to-save-money-cleaning-1900935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean and tidy</a> without destroying your budget. The vacuums below might have a few limitations compared to our overall best vacuum picks, but they will still get the job done and tackle <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/right-way-to-vacuum-your-carpet-2908791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer">pet hair, dust, and debris</a>, but at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>While they won’t last forever, these vacuums will do their jobs for a few years, until you’re in a position to upgrade your machine.</p><p>Here, the best budget vacuums on the market right now.</p><p>With the Eureka Blaze, you're essentially paying for three cleaning tools in one—at a price that can't be beat. This top-rated budget pick weighs less than 4 pounds and functions as an upright stick vacuum, handheld vacuum, and a stair vacuum. Wherever you take it around the house, it handily picks up pet hair, dust, and small debris. Our reviewer noted that it may struggle to suck up larger debris without clogging while in the upright mode, but the wider mouth on the dust buster insert should solve that issue.</p><p>This model comes with a crevice tool and steers on a swivel, allowing it to access nooks and crannies high and low. It works exceedingly well on hardwood, tile, linoleum, and low-pile rugs, but may need multiple passes to remove dirt from fluffy, high-pile carpeting. Whether you're tidying up the staircase or clearing crumbs out of the furniture, this versatile vacuum will get the job done, without leaving a dent in your wallet.</p><p>Don’t want to be limited by a power cord as you clean? Then you need a cordless vacuum like the powerful Shark Navigator Freestyle Stick Vacuum. This lightweight design is great for quick cleanup jobs on all types of surfaces, and it has a runtime of around 24 minutes on bare floors and 17 minutes on carpets.</p><p>The Shark Navigator needs four hours to charge up the battery, and at 7.5 pounds, it’s light enough to carry all around your home. It offers a two-speed brushroll for carpets and bare floors, and the extra-large dust cup is easy to empty. This stick vacuum excels at <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/inexpensive-ways-to-remove-pet-hair-2821474" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">picking up pet hair</a>, making it a great investment for pet owners.</p><p>Handheld vacuums are ideal for picking up small messes around the house, and one of the top-rated affordable products in this category is the Black+Decker Dustbuster. This compact vacuum weighs just 2 pounds, and its lithium battery provides strong suction and extended runtime.</p><p>This handheld vacuum has a larger dust cup, allowing you to collect 50 percent more dirt before you need to empty it, and the washable bowl and filter let you keep the transparent vacuum looking pristine. Its wide mouth is great for picking up large debris—like spilled ingredients in the kitchen—and the vacuum comes with a wall mount so it’s always within reach.</p><p>This inexpensive vacuum comes with a crevice tool and brush tool, plus it delivers impressive suction and is easy to clean.</p><p>Robotic vacuums can be really expensive—new models often cost close to $1,000! However, you can get the hands-off cleaning abilities of a robot vacuum at an affordable price with the Pure Clean Automatic Robot Vacuum. This affordable model costs is a fraction of the price, and it has all the features you’d expect—and then some.</p><p>The Pure Clean Robot Vacuum has a 90-minute run time, and all you have to do to start it is press a button! It works well on tile, hard floors, and short carpets, and it has a built-in cliff sensor that will stop it from falling down stairs. This robot vacuum has a thin 3-inch profile that lets it fit under furniture, and it picks up dirt and dust with its dual rotating brushes. The Pure Clean Robot Vacuum does a great job capturing pet hair and dirt, making it a wonderful option for daily tidying.</p><p>If you’re partial to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/upright-vacuum-versus-canister-vacuum-4072906" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">canister vacuums</a>, the Bissell Zing is a budget-friendly option that doesn't skimp on performance. This bagless model uses cyclonic technology to create powerful suction that captures dirt on both carpets and hard floors.</p><p>The Bissell Zing weighs less than 8 pounds, making it easy to move around your home. It has a 15-foot retractable power cord, and the large dirt cup is easy to empty with the push of a button. You can alternate between <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/right-way-to-vacuum-your-carpet-2908791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning carpets</a> (even thick, high-pile rugs) and hard floors with the flip of a switch, and the vacuum comes with a crevice tool and dusting brush, as well.</p><p>If you have one or more pets, you know how quickly pet hair can take over your home. Regular vacuuming and dusting is a must in pet households, and the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser will be a welcome addition to your cleaning arsenal.</p><p>This compact corded hand vacuum is specially designed to tackle pet hair. The rubber nozzle lets you remove more hair from furniture and stairs, and the suction nozzle works wonders on dry messes around the house. Plus, this handheld vacuum has a multi-level filtration system to <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-allergies-2804677" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">trap household allergens</a>, and its lightweight design is perfect for cleaning the stairs or even the inside of your car! The rubber nozzle for this vacuum i}s a particularly useful feature, as it scrapes the hair off carpets and furniture with ease.</p><p>Allergy sufferers often benefit from using a bagged vacuum, rather than a bagless model, because it ensures that any allergens it sucks up stay sealed away until its bag is safely tossed in the trash. This bagged option from Eureka provides that same sense of security at an approachable price.</p><p>In addition to its triple filtration bag system, this model features a highly portable and lightweight design, a deluxe floor brush, a bare floor nozzle, and a blower port that should come in handy when vacuuming the garage or porch. Meanwhile, the included crevice tool and upholstery brush make messes in corners and on furniture easy to access. Irritating dust, dander, and debris won't stand a chance against this mighty little machine.</p><p>Not only does the Bissell Featherweight Stick Vacuum come in several stylish colors, it makes cleaning up hard surfaces a snap. It can even clean up minor messes on countertops, thanks to its dust buster attachment.</p><p>This vacuum’s dirt tank empties easily and holds up to .6 liters of debris. Its cord wraps tidily around the length of the stick's handle, allowing you to store it without risk of it getting tangled. For quick cleanups on furniture or in small spaces, switch to the crevice tool. The floor nozzle can handle the rest. Behind its flashy color and simple design, Bissell's Featherweight is a highly effective, ultra lightweight vacuum for hard floors—you may never use your broom again.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Cheap Vacuum Cleaner</h2><h3>Style</h3><p>If you want robust cleaning power with a wider floorhead and larger dust bin, an inexpensive upright vacuum might be your best bet—however, it's likely to weigh more than other options. There are also more compact canister vacuums, which are great for stairs, and stick vacuums that are lightweight and easily maneuvered. Even robotic vacuums can be found on a budget, so really, no style of vacuum is off the table.</p><h3>Dust bin and filters</h3><p>Keep recurring costs low by looking for a budget vacuum with a dust bin instead of bags that need to be replaced. Just make sure that you keep the dust bin clean to prevent a loss of suction power and performance from your vacuum. Washable filters will also reduce ongoing costs since they can be rinsed clean.</p><h3>Cordless</h3><p>Are you looking to cut the cord but keep the price tag in check with your next vacuum cleaner? While many budget-friendly vacuums are still corded models, there are some great stick vacuums available that cost less than $100. Just be sure to check the battery life and make sure that it's adequate for your cleaning needs.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How often should I replace a vacuum?</h3><p>Generally, you can <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lifespan-of-small-appliances-4169933" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">expect a vacuum to last</a> for about eight years. Several factors can affect that estimate, including how much you use it, what you do to maintain it, and what style of vacuum it is (for example, a sturdy upright vacuum will likely work for longer than a robotic model). Of course, if your vacuum is on the less expensive side, that may come at the cost of a few additional years of functionality.</p><h3>How do I clean a vacuum?</h3><p>Your first step should always be to empty your vacuum, either by throwing away its dust bag or releasing the dust cup into the trash. Next, use a microfiber cloth to wipe any remaining fine debris from the vacuum's interior. Depending on your model, you may be able to wash out the inside with soap and water, and even rinse out the filter. However, some vacuums have replaceable filters or can't get wet at all, so make sure to refer to your vacuum's manual before starting to clean it. Your last step should be checking the wheels and cleaner head for hair wrap. If you do use water to clean your vacuum, let everything air dry before reassembling.</p><h3>What should I expect from a budget vacuum?</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, vacuums that are on the more affordable end of the spectrum may lack some of the bells and whistles you'd find on higher-end models, like a wide array of attachments, intensely powerful suction, and a spacious dust cup. There are plenty of vacuums that will cover your essential cleaning needs at an affordable price, but if you're looking for a more specialized machine you may need to look at a higher price point.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert. From canister models to dustbusters, she’s researched what it takes for a vacuum to stand out in a vast and broad market—and what to look for in up-and-coming models. She personally loves and relies on BLACK+DECKER’s Dusbuster, our pick for best inexpensive handheld, to tackle small messes in her studio apartment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, that's right. Girls are powerful and so are these women, especially when it comes to creating beautiful and useful pieces from wood, metal, and more. These girls are kicking butt in an historically male-dominated industry, and we cannot get enough! Here we find out how they got started and how you can, too.</em></p><h2>About The Pneumatic Addict Elisha Albretsen</h2><p><strong>What: </strong>DIY blogger, YouTuber, and self-proclaimed tool addict<br/><strong>Where: </strong><a href="https://www.pneumaticaddict.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Blog</a>,<a href="https://jenwoodhouse.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PneumaticAddict" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pneumaticaddict/_created/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pneumaticaddict/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD02RAib9K0kob8UMWwLMSA/videos" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="6">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pneumaticaddict" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="7">Twitter</a>, based in Mesa, Arizona</p><p>Based just outside of Phoenix, Elisha Albretsen never expected to get into woodworking. But as she has learned more than a few times, sometimes, life has other plans. We connected with the blogger known as <a href="https://www.pneumaticaddict.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">The Pneumatic Addict</a> to discuss how the combination of a strict budget and surprise identical twin boys turned her toward a career as a digital DIYer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/WLUEFrT5yzJALUZb5YEOStGzT2Q=/1738x1198/opening-rolling-mirror-a437829d1ec54206b0f64af70e3d9c6c.jpg" alt="Elisha Albretsen opening custom mirrored wall cabinet" width="1738" height="1198" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Elisha Albretsen</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Handy From a Young Age</h2><p>“I grew up in a family that was really handy," said Elisha. "Both my parents are just very practical people with lots of skills. [If] the dishwasher broke, Dad checked out a book from the library, and we had to fix it. Mom would sew curtains for all the houses we lived in. We grew up... just being DIYers, more or less.”</p><p>But while she was no stranger to being crafty, it was Elisha’s husband who already had a foundation of woodworking knowledge. “My husband comes from a family of contractors; his dad was a house framer. He had been framing houses since he was 14—so he's a really handy guy, too.”</p><h2>Newlyweds on a Budget</h2><p>The pair married in 2007 and, as Elisha said, “the economy was not so great for contractors.” Elisha worked as a hairstylist, and the two struggled to find their footing. Then, Elisha learned she was unexpectedly pregnant—with twins!</p><p>“That totally blew me away.”</p><p>By the end of 2009, Elisha was on bedrest. Her husband still struggled to find contractor work, and the couple turned to their savings for as long as they could manage. “Once the savings were gone, I had these two really high-demand newborns that prevented me from being able to go to work full time, like I thought it was going to be able to do. And my husband was just trying to take whatever job he could.”</p><h2>Elisha's First Toolset</h2><p>Shortly after getting married, the newlyweds bought a washer and dryer off Craigslist. The seller offered to throw in an “old school Ryobi combo kit for ten bucks.” Along with a drill and tiny circular saws, Elisha began to build up a small tool stash, perfect for DIY projects around the house. “Everything else, I borrowed from my father-in-law.” </p><p>With two newborns and a savings account at zero, Elisha began cutting hair in her kitchen for friends and family while asking herself, “What else can I do?"</p><p>"My father-in-law sometimes would give me his leftover scraps from construction projects, and our neighbors would put stuff out on the curb. So I would go and grab this old broken furniture. I started building things and making them over."</p><p>When friends and family began asking if Elisha would sell them her work, she realized she might have stumbled into something. She turned to Craigslist and local craft shows to sell her work.</p><h2>The Birth of Her Next Baby: The Pneumatic Addict</h2><p>Unfortunately, Elisha soon realized that it wasn’t the most ideal way to make a living. “I'll be honest, I'm just… I'm a terrible entrepreneur,” she said with a laugh. “But I made enough money that I was able to invest a little bit of it and start a website.”</p><p>In 2010, the Pneumatic Addict was born—and it was through the comment section of her newly minted blog that people began asking for tutorials. “It just kind of grew on from there.”</p><p>As Elisha's project portfolio expanded, so did her tool collection. “The first [tool] that I have any sort of connection to was my pneumatic brad nailer. And that's actually where I get the name of my company. I got it on sale at Harbor Freight for like $16, so it was within my budget at the time.” </p><h2>Perks of a Pneumatic Life</h2><p>These days, most of Elisha’s tools are battery-operated, and new viewers are quick to point out that they've never seen her use a pneumatic tool, a power tool that is powered by compressed air.</p><p>While she's moved on in some ways, Elisha still hangs onto her original collection. “The thing that I like in particular about pneumatic tools is they're actually very affordable. Your big expense is your air compressor, but once you have [that]… you can get a really good quality pneumatic sander for forty or fifty bucks. Even now, even with cordless tools coming down [in price], they're still nowhere near that price point.” </p><p>Along with being more affordable, Elisha explained that pneumatic tools have other advantages, too. “They're usually smaller and lighter weight. I will occasionally use my old pneumatic nail guns or my pin nailer… because they're small enough, I can squeeze them into a tight space.”</p><p>“[They're also] so lightweight. I can hold it and move it all day long without my arm getting tired or without having to switch batteries.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/RqHgED_x1lVB8qpOks2ZBkrzWxY=/1024x683/built-in-bench-impact-driver-CROP-01476b12d20f4d34931cfd44d10616c3.jpg" alt="Elisha Albretsen" width="1024" height="683" /></figure><h2>Branching Out on Social</h2><p>With her blog taking off, Elisha learned other ways she could grow her online business. After resisting social media for as long as she could, she joined Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube. “I posted my first video six years ago [in 2015], just because I was going to conferences, and they said, ‘You have to have a YouTube channel.’”</p><p>She was surprised to realize that there was a definite learning curve, and her first video didn't quite go to plan. “I posted the most embarrassing, terrible video. I filmed the entire thing in one take in my garage, just talking to a camcorder... and [then] I realized that I had cut my head off."</p><p>She decided to go for it and post the video anyway, and today, it still racks up views (as seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IvuuPOVOM8" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Elisha still knew there was room for growth. “[After] learning how to edit a little bit, I started to enjoy it. And I really do see it as kind of a creative outlet. It's an art form in itself, being able to edit.”</p><h2>From This Old House to Her Dream Home</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/xsD116PLuJpCYfmtLjjoqsjJjgg=/1920x1080/MVI_8891.00_06_55_24.Still013-3ccdf70e20084b0c9a9f086ff48d3143.jpg" alt="Elisha Albretsen working on site" width="1920" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Elisha Albretsen</span></figcaption></figure><p>For Elisha, watching DIY and homebuilding projects on a screen has always been a part of her life—from way before her YouTube days. “I was kind of a weird kid. I grew up watching <em>This Old House</em> and Bob Vila and Norm Abram." Elisha laughed as she gushed about her love for the duo she calls "kind of dry and stuffy," because, even today, they're staying true to who they are. "They're not trying to be cool or hip. They're just trying to give you good information, show you how to do stuff the right way.”</p><p>But <em>This Old House </em>is more than just a quirky guilty pleasure. It also inspired a long-time dream for Elisha that recently became a reality. “Since I was eight [or] nine years old, I had a major goal and dream of building my own house one day. I had no idea how, I just wanted to. So we bought land a couple of years ago and finally, we were in a position where we could build.” </p><p>Now, a few months after moving, Elisha feels like they’re settling in. “It's stressful and it's hard. [But] it was very, very satisfying.” </p><h2>11 Months of Work Pays Off</h2><p>Alongside her husband (who’s now a structural engineer), the couple began building in February 2020. By March, he was on remote work, working from home, and somehow, the timing of the pandemic made everything a little bit easier.</p><p>“We were able to order our materials right on time. My father-in-law is still a contractor, and he told us that his contact at the lumberyard gave him a heads up that the following week they were going to be raising the price by 50%. So if we wanted to lock in a price, we needed to place our order by the end of the week.”</p><p>On Christmas Eve, 11 months after they broke ground, Elisha and her family moved into their new home. And from there, it’s been a DIYer dream. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/61h-WHUoAJG1UNkvyx8xqjVESks=/1920x1080/MVI_8891.00_05_41_15.Still012-ac974b4784584ca298a38659d48639ef.jpg" alt="Insulating roof" width="1920" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Elisha Albretsen</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Finally: (Half of) Her Own Workshop!</h2><p>While fulfilling a lifelong dream was a great motivator, “the main impetus of building a custom house was actually to be able to have a workshop,” said Elisha. In their suburb, it's not the easiest process to add a workshop to an existing home. "Our only option to be able to build a big shop was to buy land.”</p><p>These days, she also shares the workshop with her husband, who’s into amateur racing and rebuilding cars. “That's actually kind of a sore subject in our house—fighting over shelf space,” Elisha laughed. “He has the bigger half.”</p><h2>From DIY Dreams to a DIY Nightmare</h2><p>But even with a new space made for woodworking and building, Elisha has still faced her share of fails on the job. While decorating their new bedroom, she decided to finally tackle a project she’s long had on her dream list.</p><p>“I've been trying to think of what to do for the accent wall in our bedroom, and I love cork. I was looking around and I found this really inexpensive cork underlayment at Home Depot, and I thought that might be cool.”</p><p>With a clear vision in mind, Elisha considered how to implement her plan. “I was really concerned about the drywall. I wanted to make sure that if I changed my mind… [I wouldn’t have to] rip out chunks of drywall. So I was looking around, [wondering] what would be something that would be removable? And I saw some recommendations for poster tape.” While the recommendation wasn’t specifically for hanging cork, Elisha still felt confident it would work. “So I went out and bought all this poster tape and all the cork I needed, which was a little bit more expensive than I was expecting.” </p><p>Now working on a deadline thanks to an upcoming sponsorship, Elisha and her husband had to get to work...fast. “We stayed up to one o'clock in the morning, hanging the cork on the wall, and it looked great. My husband said it looked like a recording studio, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. It looked cool!”</p><p>Unfortunately, twenty minutes after climbing into bed, disaster struck. “We started hearing panels fall off the wall… all night long, every 20 minutes or so we would wake up hearing something crashing down to the ground.” </p><p>Now, Elisha can laugh. There’s not much to be saved from the project, though whatever she can salvage, she will. The real lesson for her is that sometimes, you can’t compromise. “You can't make it removable and have a well-secured cork wall at the same time. You’ve got to decide which one's more important to you.”</p><h2>'I Definitely Feel Othered in My Industry'</h2><p>As Elisha looks back on her journey into woodworking, she feels grateful for the support she’s received—both within the industry and from her family. But being a woman in woodworking has been an interesting experience, with a mixed bag of support from the online world. “I definitely feel othered in my industry,” said Elisha. “I get the most disgusting comments, especially from men. I get a lot of discouraging ‘bro stuff,’ but the majority of the time, it's positive. People really like seeing a woman try something new."</p><p>But, as Elisha explained, this is part of a larger issue, too. “I'm still ‘other.’ I don't want to be ‘cool for a female carpenter.’ I just want to be a carpenter. I don't necessarily want that designator on me.”</p><p>As a feminist, Elisha feels strongly that representation matters. “I love being out there so women and girls can see me,” she explained. But she also feels passionate that that side of woodworking shouldn’t be a requirement for getting into the industry. “If women [don't want] to make a statement with their career or their hobby, you can do that too. You can just do it without having to be a social justice warrior. Just do what you like.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/cCuFVfBLgaJUxeWFqoVjWxwNLUg=/1795x1197/diy-poplar-wood-floating-stairs-install-house-CROP-508a6a83d3324fb99b377c613fe0e47e.jpg" alt="Elisha Albretsen" width="1795" height="1197" /></figure><h2>Words of Wisdom for Newbies on a Budget</h2><p>When it comes to starting, Elisha agrees it’s important to just dive in and get started. But she also feels there’s an aspect to this industry that isn’t addressed enough.</p><p>“It does take some money to get started," said Elisha. "You have to invest in your tools and your materials. I would never, ever discourage somebody from getting into it because they feel like they don't have the ability to invest a lot of money into their hobby or in their business. There are always other ways to do it. But don't compare yourself to somebody who has the ability to purchase a fully outfitted shop, or who can buy the highest quality materials.”</p><p>“Recognize that there are privileges that some people come into this industry with.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 8 Best Air Fresheners of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/_cSYNo4zlF-5RYf0x_uwAN7sVj4=/3330x2253/luxury-master-bathroom-with-free-standing-bath-tub-157185449-5b8832c146e0fb002557ea72.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[A great air freshener eliminates odors and keeps your space smelling fresh. We researched the best ones so you can find the right pick for your home.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may not realize how important it is to have fresh, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/indoor-air-pollution-and-how-to-clean-it-up-3017217" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">clean air in your home</a>—until there's a smell you can't shake. Stale stuffy air, combined with odors from laundry and gym wear, bathroom smells, left-over dinner aromas, and musty areas, can create an environment that your nose finds unbearable. Solutions vary, and range from sprays to gels to plug-ins and more. It's all about finding the right scent and medium for your space and the smells you're battling.</p><p>No matter why you want to give your space a boost, these are the best air fresheners.</p><p>It’s hard to find an air freshener more versatile than the Renuzit Gel Air Freshener. The 98 percent naturally sourced, biodegradable gel cone doesn’t require batteries, you don’t need to plug it into an outlet, and there’s nothing to spray. It’s easy to operate—just twist and lift the cap. You can control the amount of fragrance by raising or lowering the cap.</p><p>Since the gel cone is small, it will fit in almost any space, so you can use it in almost any room. They're also one of the less expensive options, so you can place one in every room and experiment with various scents.</p><p>Best of all, it comes in almost two dozen scents including After the Rain, Pure Breeze, Tranquil Falls, and Hawaiian Sunset. And if you like the scent of Snuggle Dryer sheets, the gel cone air freshener is also available in two Snuggle scents.</p><p>Considering everything that happens in your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-car-interior-4775265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">car</a>—from eating and spilling food, transporting other humans and pets, and often driving with the windows up due to extreme cold or heat, it's normal for smells to develop. However, the Febreze Car Air Freshener Vent Clip makes it easy to banish those smells. As its name implies, you merely clip the air fresher to your car vent, and then you can adjust how much of the scent is released.</p><p>On the low setting, each vent clip lasts for an average of 30 days. There are over two dozen scents to choose from, including Linen & Sky, Fresh-Twist Cranberry, Sea Spray, and also two Gain Laundry Detergent scents.</p><p>One place you don’t want odors to linger: in the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/bathroom-cleaning-checklist-4788311" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">bathroom</a>. It can often be embarrassing for both parties when one person is exiting the bathroom and another person is entering the space. Poo-Pourri Before-You-Go Toilet Spray can help you avoid such unpleasantries. By spraying the scent directly onto the water in the toilet bowl, a barrier is created to trap odors underneath the surface.</p><p>The spray is made of natural ingredients—including essential oils—and is free of aerosols and parabens. Besides the original citrus scent, it’s also available in other options, such as Lavender Peppermint, Lavender Vanilla, Tropical Hibiscus, and Vanilla Mint. You can also use Poo-Pourri in your kitchen trashcan, as well as in your laundry room or other areas with strong odors.</p><p>If you like air freshener options that you can set and forget, consider the Glade PlugIns Air Freshener Start Kit, which includes the fragrance warmer that you plug into an outlet and five refills. You can adjust the amount of scent that's released based on the size of the room and how strong you want the fragrance to be.</p><p>Some of the fragrance options you can choose from include Tropical Blossoms, Hawaiian Breeze, Apple Cinnamon, Cashmere Woods, Clean Linen, and Lavender & Aloe.</p><p>Another set-and-forget option is an automatic spray air freshener. The Glade Automatic Spray Refill and Holder Kit uses two AA batteries and includes three settings so you can dispense a burst of fragrance every 9, 18, or 36 minutes—although there's an off setting as well for overnight or when you're away on a trip. In addition, there’s a Boost Button that you can press to release fragrance whenever you desire.</p><p>Each canister lasts for an average of 60 days, and the dispenser has a low refill indicator to let you know when it's time to swap out canisters. Aqua Waves, Clean Linen, and Blooming Peony & Cherry are some of the many fragrances available, depending on your likes.</p><p>If you're like to add a fresh scent to your bedroom, the Caldrea Linen and Room Spray Air Freshener is perfect for you. Free from artificial colors, formaldehyde, aerosol, and parabens, it’s made of essential oils and is safe enough to spray in the air or even on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/toughest-odors-to-remove-from-clothes-2146161" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">garments</a> and linens without leaving stains.</p><p>This spray is perfect if you don't need a continuous air freshener, but would like something to refresh your room every once in awhile. Scent options include Pear Blossom Agave, Rosewater Driftwood, Lavender Cedar Leaf, and more.</p><p>The MOSO Natural Charcoal Air Purifying Bag stands out because it is available in a variety of packaging and sizes. For example, there’s a free-standing option that lets you place it anywhere without worrying about it toppling over. There’s also a smaller size that can be hung in closets, bathrooms, or tucked into drawers. The car MOSO bag can be used in cars, SUVs, and trucks.</p><p>All of the MOSO bags are made of bamboo charcoal and are free from fragrances entirely. Each bag absorbs odors and moisture, and only requires one hour in the sun each month to maintain effectiveness. The bags last for up to two years and the contents are biodegradable. Plus, there is a place on each bag to write the date the packaging was opened, so you’ll remember when to put it in the sun, and when two years have passed, so you can recycle the bag’s contents in your backyard.</p><p>Sometimes, especially when you’re dealing with odors like smoke, you need something stronger than a traditional air freshener. The Air Choice Air Purifier is a small appliance that has a pre-filter that removes dust, lint, and allergens, in addition to an ionizer filter that removes odors and smoke, and a True HEPA filter that removes tiny airborne substances.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/should-you-buy-an-air-purifier-1708890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">air purifier</a> is designed to clean 215 square feet of air in ten minutes, and refresh the air six times an hour.  It’s easy to operate with just one button that turns it on and off, and controls the three fan settings. The lowest setting is quiet enough that it won’t interrupt your sleep. At just about 5.5 pounds, it’s easy to move to different rooms when needed.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Air Freshener</h2><h3>Scent</h3><p>Do you want fragrant air freshener or one with no scent? When making this decision, also consider others—and depending on your environment, this could be family members, friends, or even co-workers —who may be sensitive to heavy perfumes. Some air fresheners could make allergies and asthma worse, and pets can also be sensitive to artificial fragrances.</p><p>You’ll also need to decide if you want an air freshener that would allow you to control the level of fragrance released if that’s important to you. Some air fresheners let you adjust intensity, while others are more all or nothing.</p><h3>Type</h3><p>If you have children and pets, a plug in may not be the best option—unless the outlets are high enough that they can’t be reached. Gels and sprays can also be dangerous if ingested, so they'll need to out of reach of kids and pets. Bamboo charcoal is harmless from a poison perspective, but could be a choking hazard, if the bags are torn open. </p><p>Choosing a type also means choosing how easy-to-use or customizable you want your air freshener to be. Something you can plug into an outlet or set on a table is more convenient than having to spray air freshener all of the time, and might be a better pick for areas with consistent smell issues, like a laundry room or bathroom. On the other hand, if you only want to freshen the air on certain occasions, like when company is coming over, it may be easier to just spray the air before your guests arrive.</p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>If you have strong odors, you'll need to treat the source of the smell in addition to adding a freshener on top of it. Nothing smells worse than bad odors mixed with perfume. However, sometimes you’ll need to experiment with products to find the one that works best for your needs. If moisture is a problem, bamboo charcoal does a better job of absorbing it than sprays or oils, but if your room just needs a gentle refresh, those methods should work fine.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/terri-williams-5180777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Terri Williams</a> is a professional writer who has tested hundreds of products.

<title>The 8 Best Hardwood Floor Vacuums of 2021</title>

<description><![CDATA[A good vacuum should pick up dirt without damaging your floors. We researched the best vacuums for hardwood floors so you can pick the right one for your space.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hardwood-flooring-mistakes-4172018" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardwood floors</a> can last a lifetime but require the right care—and frequent cleaning. Everything from pet hair to dust and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hardwood-kitchen-flooring-1314994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">crumbs</a> show up on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/most-durable-floorings-you-can-install-1821624" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">hard surface floors</a>, including wood, laminate, and tile. A vacuum designed for hardwood floors is an essential cleaning tool for keeping your floors spotless and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/repair-scratched-hardwood-floors-4155230" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratch-free</a>. </p><p>While many vacuums have a brush roll with stiff bristles designed to work up dirt hidden deep within carpet fibers, a hardwood floor vacuum will take a softer approach. Some hardwood floor vacuums have a brush roll with super soft bristles, while others omit the brush roll altogether. At the same time, you’ll want to make sure that the vacuum offers enough suction to capture dirt and debris without scattering it over a wider surface. </p><p>Regardless of whether you’re shopping for an upright vacuum, an easy-rolling canister vacuum, or a cordless vacuum for hardwood floors, these top options offer plenty of power, efficient operation, and features designed with bare floors in mind.</p><p>Make your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hardwood-flooring-mistakes-4172018" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood floors</a> smooth and debris-free with a top performing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-buying-guide-1909001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">vacuum cleaner</a>, like the Shark Navigator Lift-Away. This versatile vacuum offers plenty of suction, a bagless design for easy dirt disposal, and the option for brush roll shut-off to preserve the finish and feel of your hardwood floors. When used as an upright model, you’ll easily be able to cover plenty of square footage pushing this lightweight vacuum along. If you need to vacuum stairs or other elevated areas, it offers a lift-away canister vacuum option.</p><p>The advantage of the Shark Navigator Lift-Away for hardwood floors is the fact that it’s gentle enough for vacuuming hardwood floors while offering substantial suction for deep carpet cleaning. Just be sure to turn the brush roll off before gliding over bare floors. The transition from one floor setting to the next is quick and simple—you literally just flip a switch.</p><p>Bare floors tend to readily show hair, dust, and dirt, and a robot vacuum for hardwood floors is an effortless way to keep your floors clean and tidy. With 1500Pa of suction power, the eufy 30C suctions up the crumbs, pet hair, and debris with ease on wood, laminate, tile, and even low-to-medium pile carpeted floors. It offers self-charging capabilities and while it doesn’t map your home like some smart robot vacs, its multiple cleaning modes get the job done. </p><p>The eufy 30C offers 100 minutes of runtime on bare floors, which is great if you’re shopping for a hardwood floor robot vacuum. Even when it makes the step up to clean carpeted areas, the extra boost in power offered by this model ensures that it has enough suction to give a deep clean while only reducing battery power to about 45 minutes. At the end of its run time, the eufy robot finds its way back to its dock and juices up for its next run. You can manually start the robot using the included remote control, by scheduling set run-times in the eufy app, or with compatible smart home assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.</p><p>A cordless vacuum for hardwood floors makes it quick and convenient to capture messes wherever they happen—no cords to wrangle or outlets to find. At the same time, you want a vacuum designed with hardwood floors in mind to avoid stiff or damaging bristles. The Dyson Cyclone V10 combines superior suction and a soft roller head meant to effortlessly clean bare floors at a moment’s notice. A separate head with a motor-driven beater bar is included for carpets and deeper cleaning where agitation is needed, but you won’t be needing that for cleaning your hardwood floors. All of the Dyson Absolute’s attachments dock on a wall-mounted charging station that makes it simple to swap accessories and get to work cleaning quickly and easily. </p><p>The most common complaint of the Dyson Cyclone V10 is that it has a trigger you must hold down for operation. The design saves battery power—it only operates when the trigger is engaged. But also means that if you have a lot of square footage to cover, you may get tired of having to hold down the trigger. Even still, the freedom and flexibility of having a cordless vacuum for hardwood floors eliminates any excuses or hesitancy to pick up the vacuum for messes small and large. At the same time, this vacuum is capable enough to handle daily cleaning duty with a 0.2 gallon dust bin and a 40-minute run time. </p><p>If you're looking for a lightweight vacuum that can still handle big-time messes on hard surface floors, the Shark Rocket should be your first pick. Weighing less than 9 pounds and equipped with a 25 ounce-capacity dust cup, this model can tackle serious messes despite its diminutive size. Its swivel steering head, and the fact that it can convert into a handheld vacuum, means it can reach those messes even if they land in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>Thanks to its self-cleaning brushroll, which is designed for continuous hair removal with no risk of tangling or hair wrap along the way, this nimble vacuum is great for cleaning up shedding, dander, and anything else that would otherwise clog up a vacuum's brush. And while most stick vacuums are battery powered and need to be recharged every 30 to 45 minutes, this pick comes with a 30-foot cord, so you can clean for as long as you need.</p><p>Canister vacuums offer the convenience of easy rolling across hardwood or bare floors. While carpets typically benefit from the pushing and pulling motion of an upright vac, the Bissell Hard Floor Expert canister vacuum offers targeted suction from the hardwood floor attachment head without scattering crumbs and debris. Another floor-friendly feature is the felt tread on each wheel, which prevent scuffs and scratches as you wheel this vacuum from one room to the next. </p><p>You'll definitely be impressed by what this model can do on hardwood in terms of performance and function. However, if you do have carpet or area rugs to vacuum as well, you’ll be happy to know a separate floor attachment for carpeted surfaces is included along with the Bissel Hard Floor Expert vacuum. While the vacuum’s performance is typically judged on its outstanding ability to clean bare floors, it will get the job done on soft surfaces as well.</p><p>Living with a pet that sheds means being on constant alert for piles of fur accumulating around the house. Luckily, Bissell's ICONPet cordless vacuum is designed with shedders in mind and capable of removing hair wherever it might turn up. Simply switch between the "Everyday Cleaning" and "Max Cleaning" settings when transitioning between hard floors and carpets—and convert it into a handheld model when the time comes to tidy up the car.</p><p>Whether you're working across hardwood or carpet, the ICONPet features designs specifically intended to prevent hair from tangling or clogging up its inner-workings before reaching the dirt tank. No amount of hair will trip up this model, no matter how much your furry friend leaves behind.</p><p>The sealed filter system in the Miele Compact C1 ensures that, once dust and dirt goes in, it's not coming out—at least, not until you replace the 3.5-liter dust bag, which is an easy process that doesn't entail exposing yourself to allergens. In addition to its AirClean system, this canister vacuum comes with a floorhead designed with hardwood floors in mind. Its rubberized wheels save your floor from scratches, while the metal plate helps it glide cross the floor's surface, enabling powerful suction.</p><p>Speaking of suction, this model features six different suction settings, depending on the location and severity of the mess at hand. The accompanying dust brush, upholstery tool, and crevice tool will come in handy for cleaning jobs that lie beyond your hardwood floors.</p><p>Whether you're cleaning your floors, stairs, or even countertops, this wallet-friendly vacuum converts to suit your needs. The whole model tidies up hard floors and area rugs alike; the hand vacuum insert works on above-floor surfaces and furniture; and the hand vacuum attaches directly to the floor nozzle to dust off steps (at 3 pounds, it's light enough to carry up and down multiple flights). The crevice tool helps clean nooks and crannies.</p><p>The dirt tank empties from the bottom and the cord wraps around the stand without risk of tangling, making storing the FeatherWeight as easy as it is to use. Where it lacks in bells and whistles, this model makes up for in simple cleaning power.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Hardwood Floor Vacuum</h2><h3>Vacuum style</h3><p>No matter what style of vacuum you prefer, there’s probably a version specially designed for hardwood floors. Options include canister vacuums, which are easy to empty, cordless vacuums, which are incredibly portable, robot vacuums, which require little effort on your part, and even more. There are benefits to every type, so it’s a matter of which features work best with your lifestyle.</p><h3>Attachments</h3><p>Depending on how you plan to use your vacuum, you may want to prioritize certain attachments. Some popular options are dusting, crevice, upholstery, and pet attachments, all of which can come in handy around the house. </p><h3>Weight</h3><p>Many people don’t think about weight when purchasing a new vacuum, but this is a key factor that can impact whether you ultimately like the product. A vacuum that’s too heavy will be a burden to push around your home, but one that’s too light may get knocked over easily. </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Are vacuums safe for hardwood floors?</h3><p>If your home primarily has hardwood floors, you might be concerned about how to go about cleaning them without leaving a trail of scratches along the way. Rest assured—you can clean your hardwood floors with a vacuum without running the risk of damaging them. You just have to make sure your vacuum has a few key features that will ensure gentle (but effective) cleaning, including adjustable height and suction settings, felted or rubberized wheels, and, in some models, a softer cleaning head.</p><h3>When is it better to vacuum, rather than sweep, hardwood floors?</h3><p>Sweeping is an excellent way to clean up large debris, but if your hardwood floors are particularly dusty or covered in small debris, you should opt for a vacuum instead. Thanks to their suction power, vacuums can pick up fine dirt and dust particles that brooms might not be able to. If you want a thoroughly cleaned floor, opt for a vacuum over sweeping.</p><h3>Will a robotic vacuum clean hardwood floors?</h3><p>As noted above, using a robotic vacuum is one of the least labor-intensive ways to keep your home clean. And, as long as your robotic vacuum of choice has the ability to adjust its height and suction settings (some models can do this automatically, while others may require you to change the settings remotely or via an app), you can count on it to clean hardwood and tile as effectively as it cleans carpeted areas.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was edited and updated by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

Buying a matching washer and dryer is about more than just aesthetics, though, since both machines will have capacity and functions that pair together to make <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-hacks-4684443" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry day more efficient</a>. You can also catch a break in pricing by purchasing a washer and dryer bundle from major retailers. </p><p>Whether you're shopping for the newest innovations in washer and dryer sets or a budget pair to get clothes clean, you can find great options in top loading and front loading configurations. For those with small spaces, a compact or stackable washer and dryer is a good bet, while large families will most likely need a large capacity duo. </p><p>Here, the best washer and dryer sets to make laundry day easier. </p><p>The best front loading washer and dryer set should offer efficient cleaning and drying, plenty of cycle options to meet your laundry needs, and enough capacity to handle large or bulky loads.

Load capacity for this front loading washer is up to 20 pounds, which equates to about 12 large bath towels or 22 sweatshirts. LG’s TurboWash™ 360° Technology uses five water jets to make sure that even large loads are thoroughly saturated for faster cleaning in less time, while 12 cycle options give you the right settings for every type of fabric.</p><p>This laundry pair is made complete with LG’s DLEX4000W dryer, which has 7.4 cubic feet of drum space to match the capacity of its washing partner. If you enable Smart Pairing™ in LG’s ThinQ® app, the washer can share cycle information with the dryer—activating the right drying settings for your last load of wash. And to get you by in between laundry days, the dryer is equipped with a steam function to refresh lightly worn clothes or release wrinkles in between washes.</p><p>For a top of the line top loading washer and dryer set, check out the full-featured Samsung WA7200. Equipped with the features you need to make washing and drying your clothes as easy as possible, this top-loading washer and dryer set is sleek and smart. It’s also tough on stains, with an Active WaterJet built into the washer to give you a helping hand on pre-treating stains. </p><p>The 5.4 cubic foot <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-top-load-washing-machine-works-2145865" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">top loading washer</a> features a deep fill option to make sure that even bulky loads are thoroughly saturated, but its high-efficiency impeller plate design means increased water savings on light to average laundry loads. Peer into the stylish glass lid to check on the cycle—or better yet, receive cycle updates on your smartphone from this WiFi-enabled laundry pair. </p><p>The matching Samsung Dryer DV7200 offers 7.4 cubic feet of drum space and utilizes Sensor Dry to optimize the time and temperature of drying cycles. This translates to more efficient energy usage and also protects your clothes from excessive heat. </p><p>Popular in apartments and condos, a laundry center is a vertically stacked washer and dryer that functions as a single unit. Unlike stackable washer dryer sets where the washer and dryer are two separate appliances and can also be positioned side-by-side, a laundry center is a single appliance. </p><p>While laundry centers are usually quite basic in form and function, LG’s WashTower is a game-changer and a head-turner. This sleek-looking tower features a front loading washer and dryer, a departure from the familiar top-loading washer usually seen in laundry centers. Load capacity is improved, too. The washer features 4.5 cubic feet of drum space, which is on par with many standalone washing machines. The dryer keeps up with 7.4 cubic feet of room. In both appliances, you’ll have plenty of cycles and options to choose from, but you can also let AI sensors do the work for you—this technology automatically detects fabric texture and load size to select the right cycle. </p><p>One of the more innovative design features of the LG WashTower is the central control panel. While some laundry centers or stackable washer and dryer sets have hard-to-reach controls for the dryer, LG put the panel for both the washer and dryer in the center of the tower, about the height of your average countertop, so options are easy to see and controls are simple to use. </p><p>For a full-featured top loading washer and dryer set, consider this powerful pair from LG. Combining some of the newest innovations in laundry care, this sleek and smart washer and dryer duo defies the norms of conventional top-loading washers and dryers. While the price tag for this pair is steep, the cleaning capabilities are impressive. </p><p>The LG WT7305CV top-loading washer has a supersized capacity of 4.8 cubic feet and offers eight different wash programs with more than a dozen options to customize your wash cycle. A stainless steel tub means no opportunities for snags on your shirts or sweaters. LG has also engineered this washer with an advanced agitator that provides four-way motion for clothes to ensure more thorough cleaning. </p><p>Completing this splurge washer and dryer set is LG’s DLE7300VE dryer, which is available in both gas and electric models. A unique feature of this model is the EasyLoad door, which opens in two different ways to match the configuration of your laundry room; open the door down or to the side to access the interior of the 7.3 cubic foot drum. Both machines are WiFi-enabled and users can monitor laundry cycles and troubleshoot any pop-up problems using LG’s ThinQ app. </p><p>The best smart washer and dryer set should work seamlessly with top smart home applications while offering the latest features and options. The GE GFW850SPNRS Ultra Fresh Washer and matching dryer are leading the way in laundry innovation with their combination of smart capabilities and advanced features. </p><p>For instance, this 5.0 cubic foot front-loading washer is capable of washing and drying small loads on the spot—with no need to transfer to the dryer. With UltraFresh technology, the door of this washer is vented as a defense against musty odors, and gaskets and seals are treated with Microban to prevent the growth of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/prevent-mold-in-washer-1908440" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">mold</a> and mildew. When transferring normal-sized loads to the dryer, the matching GE GFD85ESPNRS gas or electric dryer steps up with 7.8 cubic feet of space and Washer Link technology that enables it to mirror settings from the washer for a just-right drying cycle. </p><p>Built-in WiFi means that this smart washer dryer set works with smart home services like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and IFTTT technology. You can also use GE’s SmartHQ app to remotely start, stop, or check in on washer and dryer cycles. Keep an eye on your laundry without stepping foot in the laundry room, thanks to the latest in smart home appliances. </p><p>Maximize energy efficiency without sacrificing cleaning power with this washer and dryer duo from Electrolux. This powerful yet energy-efficient washer and dryer set will maximize your water savings while minimizing energy usage. The Electrolux EFLS627UTT front-loading washer has earned EnergyStar’s ‘Most Efficient’ rating, and it also carries a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/home-appliances-cee-1908480" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">CEE Tier III rating</a>; pair it with the Electrolux EFMG627UTT gas dryer for maximum energy efficiency. </p><p>This washer is estimated to use just 85 kWh of energy (about $10) per year, while many other models are estimated at double or triple this usage. Aside from outstanding energy savings, Electrolux has designed this washer with other practical features. Cycle selections include a 15-minute fast wash, ultra-gentle hand wash, or sanitizing option to remove up to 99 percent of bacteria and 95 percent of common household allergens. Steam rises from the bottom of the drum in this washer to help lift stains from the fibers of your clothes, towels, and more. Finally, Electrolux has delivered a better way to use popular laundry pods in a front load washer with this model’s adaptive detergent dispenser. </p><p>Electrolux’s matching dryer, model EFMG627UTT, is no slouch in terms of efficiency or power, either. It features an automatic drying sensor to ensure that cycles end when your clothes are dry. Plus, it matches up to the specialty cycles offered by the washer by giving you an option for a 15-minute fast dry or a steam cycle to quickly release wrinkles and freshen clothes. Stack this washer and dryer pair to save space while you save energy, or place them side-by-side for easy access. Regardless of what you choose, this full-featured but energy-efficient washer and dryer pair will make your laundry life a little easier. </p><p>Spend less and launder more with this budget washer and dryer set from Amana. While the top-loading washer and matching dryer are simple by design and won’t win any awards for capacity or features, they offer excellent cleaning and drying performance for average household laundry needs. </p><p>The Amana NTW4516FW has 3.5 cubic feet of space in the porcelain wash basket, which is smooth enough to prevent snags but could become chipped over time. A dual-action agitator pole ensures a more thorough movement of clothes during each cycle. You’ll get straightforward cycle selections, without specialty options like a hand-wash or steam cycle. One popular feature, however, is the Deep Fill option, which gives large or heavily soiled loads thorough saturation. </p><p>Its matching dryer is available in either gas or electric models and gives you 6.5 cubic feet of drum space to dry loads. The machine’s automatic drying sensors control cycle length to ensure more efficient energy usage and are available on both low heat and high heat cycle settings. Or, you can opt for straightforward timed dry or air only settings. </p><p>If mountains of laundry loom large on laundry day, make sure you choose a large capacity washer and dryer set that can make quick work of dirty loads. While many average washing machines have a capacity between 3.5 and 4.5 cubic feet, the LG WM9500HKA has 5.8 cubic feet of drum space—making this a ‘mega capacity’ front-loading washer. The matching LG DV7200 dryer is equally capable at large-scale laundry loads with its 9.0 cubic foot capacity. If you’re not convinced on how large this washer and dryer set is, consider the fact that it can wash and dry a King size blanket plus an entire set of sheets in a single cycle. </p><p>Aside from being big, this large capacity laundry pair includes practical design details and smart features. For example, the washer has a 15-percent larger door opening to make it easier to load and unload those supersized piles of laundry and both machines feature an angled door that makes access easier. Steam technology gives the washer extra stain-fighting power, while the dryer can use steam to release wrinkles and refresh clothing. Both the washer and dryer are WiFi-enabled so you can check cycle status in real-time with your smartphone. </p><p>Even if you’re tight on space, you can maximize cleaning power with a powerful but compact washer dryer set like the Bosch 300 series. This German-engineered laundry pair is designed with slim dimensions to squeeze into small laundry rooms or closets; the washer and dryer both measure less than 25 inches wide and deep.  </p><p>Don’t be fooled into thinking that this compact washer dryer set is only a fit for solo individuals or couples. The front-loading Bosch WAT28400UC washing machine has a 2.2 cubic foot drum that can take on up to 18 towels in a single load. More than a dozen wash cycles, including specialty options for hand-wash items, removing allergens, or denim, give this machine major cleaning power despite its small footprint. </p><p>Save even more space by stacking the matching Bosch 300 WTG86403UC dryer on top of the washing machine. You can plug the washer into the dryer, requiring just one 240V to power both appliances. This electric condensation dryer requires no venting, opening up more possibilities for placement in your home, apartment, or condo. However, drying cycles may be extended when compared to conventional vented dryers. </p><p>Many models of front-loading washers can be stacked with a matching dryer to give you a stackable washer dryer set that takes up minimal square footage. If you’re looking for this space-saving configuration for your own laundry room or closet, consider the popular Samsung WF45R6100 washer and its accompanying dryer, model DVE45R6100. </p><p>Stackable washer dryer sets aren’t just a great idea for saving space. A dynamic duo like this washer and dryer pair can also provide thorough, complete clothes care. The front-loading washer has 4.5 cubic feet of space, with a wider drum that keeps the profile of the machine to 31.75 inches—shallow enough for many closets or small laundry rooms. Take total control of your cleaning routine with 10 cycles and options to select water temperature, rinse cycles, spin speed, and soil level for every load. The power of steam gives the machine an upper hand in fighting stains or sanitizing loads of dish towels, cleaning cloths, and more. </p><p>Put the stackable Samsung DVE45R6100P dryer on top of your washer and quickly load it up with freshly washed laundry from below. The dryer features 7.5 cubic feet of drum space and 10 drying cycles, with 5 temperature settings for optimal clothing care. Keep in mind that you’ll need to purchase a stacking kit to complete the vertical set-up, but this is to be expected with most stackable washer dryer sets. </p><p>If you’re dealing with dirty laundry, choose a washer and dryer set that can handle the load. Features like a deep fill, dual-action agitator, and extra rinse option give the Maytag MVWC565FW the upper hand on eliminating dirt, sweat, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/rules-for-removing-laundry-stains-2147154" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">stains</a>. The roomy 4.2 cubic foot stainless steel wash basket holds large loads, with plenty of room for heavy items like jeans or sweatshirts or bulky items like King size sheets or a big blanket. </p><p>A feature unique to this washing machine for stains is Maytag’s PowerWash cycle, which uses heated water and enhanced agitator action to more thoroughly clean heavily soiled loads. Activate the deep rinse feature to ensure that the load is thoroughly clean and to remove excess detergent, which can actually cause fibers to become soiled more quickly. Finish the job with the Maytag MEDC465HW dryer, which has 7 cubic feet of space and 12 cycles to dry your freshly laundered load. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/74C27PgfSxSUI8rAH8mXrB8C3Rs=/1500x1000/best-washer-dryer-sets-4109183_FINAL-a606228c9dd14350a1427c2c68bfa894.gif" alt="The Best Washer Dryer Sets" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Hilary Allison / The Spruce</span></figcaption></figure><h2>What to Look for in a Washing Machine</h2><h3>Capacity</h3><p>Since overfilling your washer will mean clothes don’t get as clean as they should and underfilling it means a waste of water and energy, you’ll want to find a washing machine with a capacity that matches your average load size. Capacity is usually measured in cubic feet and a standard washing machine typically has a drum with 3 to 4 cubic feet of space. Compact washers will have up to 2.5 cubic feet of space, and super capacity front load washers can have as much as 6 cubic feet of space.</p><p>Since you might not know how many cubic feet of space your load of laundry takes up, keep in mind that a washer with a capacity of 3 to 4 cubic feet can usually wash up to 12 pounds of laundry. Adjust up or down for washers with a smaller or larger capacity.</p><h3>Agitation</h3><p>Every washing machine relies on some form of agitation to clean clothes and loosen dirt. When you peek inside the washer, you’ll find a variety of types of agitators. In a front load washer, you’ll see a big drum with small fins protruding from all sides. These low-profile paddles combined with the turning of the drum provide gentle agitation that is better for the longevity of garments. However, this gentler agitation also means longer cycle times to ensure that clothes are clean. Inside of a top load washer, the familiar sight of a tall center agitator is being increasingly replaced with an impeller plate on the bottom of the washtub that performs a similar action while taking up less space.<br/></p><p>Typical top-loaders with the tall agitator are said to shorten the longevity of garments and can hinder the ability to wash larger, bulkier items like a comforter.</p><h3>Cycles</h3><p>While all washing machines have basic cycles to handle everyday laundry needs, some machines go above and beyond with specialized cycles for oversized items like comforters or items labeled for handwashing. Another popular option appearing on many front-loading washers and some top-loading washers is a sanitizing cycle that uses high heat to kill up to 99.9 percent of bacteria—perfect for dirty dish rags or pet bedding.</p><h3>Drum material</h3><p>Since your clothes are about to get washed and whirled inside of a machine, you want to be sure that nothing will snag the fabric of your favorite blouse. Stainless steel tubs are considered the smoothest and most durable choice for washing machine drums. They’re often included with higher-end washing machines.</p><p>Porcelain-enameled steel tubs are also popular and cost less, but over time the porcelain finish can chip or wear away—leaving exposed steel that may rust and stain or snag clothes. Less commonly seen but sometimes used in low or mid-range machines are heavy-duty plastic washtubs. While durable enough to last for many years, they may not be well-suited for high-speed spin cycles and they can develop rough spots that might catch clothes over time.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Dryer</h2><h3>Gas or electric</h3><p>To supply the hot air it will take to dry your clothes thoroughly, you’ll need a dryer with a heater that is fueled by natural gas or powered by electricity. Does your laundry room have a natural gas line that you can connect a dryer to? If not, you’ll need to install one if you want the efficiency of a gas dryer. A gas dryer will cost more initially—especially if you need to pay to have a gas line installed, and there may be additional fees to have a gas dryer hooked up during delivery. Still, this type of dryer is generally capable of drying clothes faster, and it may cost less to operate—depending on the cost of utilities in your area.</p><p>Electric dryers don’t require a separate gas line—just plug it in and it is ready to operate. You’ll generally find that electric dryers cost about $100 less than their gas counterparts. However, they typically have longer drying times, which means greater energy usage and increased costs in the long run.</p><h3>Capacity</h3><p>Make sure that you have a dryer suitably sized to handle the capacity of your washing machine. If not, you’ll have a load of soggy clothes ready for drying and only be able to fit some of it in your dryer! The rule-of-thumb used to be to find a dryer with twice the cubic capacity of the washing machine, but increased efficiency in dryer performance means that you won’t need to adhere strictly to that formula. Still, if you have a washer with a cubic capacity of 3.5 to 4.5 feet, look for a dryer with at least 7 cubic feet of drying space. This will also provide enough room to dry larger items, like queen or king-sized comforters.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/erica-puisis-4174129" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Erica Puisis</a> has been covering large appliances for The Spruce since 2017.

<description><![CDATA[The right flower bulbs will produce bright and fragrant flowers. We researched the best bulbs you can buy online—just plant, add water, and watch them grow.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Planting bulbs is one of the easiest ways to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-keep-your-garden-in-color-all-season-1402216" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">add spring and summer colors to your garden</a> and yard. All you need to do is dig a hole, drop in a bulb, and wait. Flowering bulbs are generally planted well in advance of their blooming season, so you may not be ready for a trip to the garden store to pick out your bulbs. Ordering bulbs online is a great option to have them delivered right to your home.</p><p>Just like ordering from any online retailer, you want to do your homework and make sure that you are getting a quality bulb that will grow and bloom. There’s nothing worse than planting a bulb than waiting for weeks or even months, just to be disappointed when nothing sprouts up. These retailers are a great source for flower bulbs.</p><p>Here are the best places to buy flower bulbs online.</p><h2>American Meadows</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/UALc_KuTh_dz2ePP-ukbLe3Wy38=/846x828/AmericanDawnDecorativeDahlia-82de38c75ba74aa3931a51335bb50d24.jpg" alt="American Dawn Decorative Dahlia" width="846" height="828" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of American Meadows</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a wide selection of flowering bulbs, American Meadows is a great choice that combines great value with almost every flower you could imagine. They ship directly to you at the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/when-should-i-plant-spring-blooming-bulbs-1402231" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">ideal planting time</a>, taking the guesswork out finding the right conditions to get your bulbs started. Their online catalog is separated into fall bulbs and spring bulbs. You can also search by growing conditions, such as shade or sun, or bulbs that will attract pollinators or butterflies.</p><p>The reliability of these bulbs is hit or miss, but American Meadows does offer a 1-year guarantee. So if your bulbs do not grow or bloom, you can reach out to their customer service to get a refund. Their selection of daffodils is particularly impressive and they all have great from other gardeners.</p><h2>Lowes</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ewempv94bLUhh3C-6MRfROTKLAs=/1048x1048/Gladiolus-52f83592a2fe4a8285d951895c6dad0e.jpg" alt="Gladiolus" width="1048" height="1048" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Lowes</span></figcaption></figure><p>This chain retailer has everything that you need to make your yard and garden beautiful all under one roof. If you want to plan out your garden and make one large purchase instead of keeping track of multiple shipments from a variety of retailers, this is a great choice.</p><p>Lowe’s has a decent selection of bulbs, with more available online than you will usually find in-store. During the peak planting times, you can go into the store to talk to an associate about the best bulbs for you and then order them to be delivered right to your house. Lowe’s does offer a few discounts, such as a contractor/pro discount and a military discount, but otherwise, their prices are on the middle to upper end of what you might find.</p><h2>Eden Brothers</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/uYD1ekUMY9LzekABETtfNDudbuw=/1004x1004/Anemone-40e7c03feca54cad809774f640528f05.jpg" alt="Anemone Flowers" width="1004" height="1004" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Eden Brothers</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just looking at the Eden Brothers website is enough to turn your thumb green, so ordering from them is a breeze. They separate their bulbs by planting season/growing season, as well as list what planting zones are currently being shipped those bulbs. This is important because the best time to plant flowering bulbs in Maine is very different than in Florida. Knowing your zone is a great way to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/planting-bulbs-in-a-lawn-1402230" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">get the best performance from your bulbs</a>.</p><p>The selection from Eden Brothers is also great. They have popular options, like tulips, daffodils, and gladiolus. They also have lesser-known varieties, such as echinacea, fritillaria, and others. Overall, they have over 275 varieties of fall bulbs and 280 varieties of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/spring-blooming-bulbs-1402261" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">spring bulbs</a>.</p><p>These bulbs are a little pricey but come with all the knowledge that you need to get great performance and blooms. There are Fast Facts and planting instructions online that tell beginning and experienced gardeners how to plant the bulbs, what growing conditions they prefer, and what to expect when they bloom. This high-end seed and bulb retailer is my go-to for bulbs, seeds, and general garden inspiration.</p><h2>Home Depot</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/CSy9cPXc_iLc6-E5Rh-hFcPalJY=/1196x1182/GrapeHyacinths-b80c6ce40fec40eba227d7626a922cc0.jpg" alt="Grape Hyacinths" width="1196" height="1182" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Home Depot</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like its main competitor, Lowe’s, The Home Depot has almost any commonly used home or garden product that you might need to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/before-and-after-backyard-makeovers-4684564" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">give your yard a makeover</a>. Their selection is average and their prices are just okay, better if you have a discount to use. The main advantage of ordering flowering bulbs online with The Home Depot is how easy it is to order, the reliability of the retailer in general, and the convenience of getting your entire garden order all at once.</p><p>Returns are also easier because they do have a brick-and-mortar store in most major cities and towns. If your garden plans change, you can always return your items in-store without having to worry about shipping them back to an online retailer.</p><h2>Van Egelen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/UiyO6wBc2yK45gQXWgmaY98kMHc=/722x708/ALLIUMAFLATUNENSEPURPLESENSATION-f959f853955f49569e15f0b1e1f20f4c.jpg" alt="Allium aflatunense purple sensation" width="722" height="708" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Van Egelen</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the flowering bulb purists, Van Engelen has a phenomenal selection of bulbs, generations of know-how, and a reputation for reliably blooming bulbs. Their prices are good but you will need to buy in large quantities, often a minimum shipment of 100 bulbs of a single variety. Van Engelen is a great choice for commercial gardeners or those with large expanses to fill.</p><p>They only keep bulbs in stock that are in their planting season, so if you are looking to purchase bulbs outside of that ideal window, you won’t have a lot of options. If you want or need to purchase a lot of bulbs, make sure to check out Van Engelen just before planting time when their in-stock catalog increases.</p><h2>Brecks</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/g1W8_FGaJDDeuaZrQkfdG1mRFrU=/750x760/DoubleDaffodilMixture-4777d0f9ff7c41478a94918e0451a9c6.jpg" alt="Double Daffodil Mixture" width="750" height="760" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Brecks</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because they only sell bulbs, employees at the online retailer Breck’s knows the ins and outs of selecting, planting, and growing bulbs. You can begin by searching for your growing zone, which will help you determine the best bulbs for your area as well as when to plant them. They are expensive bulbs but Breck’s offers a lifetime money-back guarantee for anyone not completely satisfied with their purchase.</p><p>The selection at Breck’s is great, with a handy search tool that will find your perfect bulbs. Search by zone, size, color, sun requirements, and more. If you’re looking to buy in bulk, you can purchase a Super Sak to save money. Not all varieties are available this way, however. They also offer some garden decor, tools, and other accents to round out your space.</p><h2>Longfield Gardens</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/jNLj4hskS5WnA6fqKKDqlrdoMqw=/1140x1108/Tulips-c7671822dfd34ca4814f3923eef45824.jpg" alt="Tulips" width="1140" height="1108" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Longfield Gardens</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you like to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/free-garden-planners-1357749" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">plan out your garden well in advance</a>, you can turn your plans into savings by taking advantage of the pre-order discount at Longfield Gardens. Another bulb-only online retailer, this family-owned company combines expertise with value.</p><p>They have a Shipping Soon section of their website, which shows the upcoming bulbs that you should consider for planting. They also have a section for pairing bulbs and divide the planting seasons into three: fall, spring, and winter (indoors). They are on the expensive side, but the company stands behind their bulbs, even testing them in their own trial garden to ensure quality.</p><h2>Costco</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/JexexzQ9SI0xcEvgF8QhsnOnnJM=/848x848/CostcoCallaLillies-d00516150c1a4550b6ff031e3629ad38.jpg" alt="Calla Lillies" width="848" height="848" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Costco</span></figcaption></figure><p>You probably already know that Costco has some great products at warehouse prices, but their flower bulbs are some of their most popular items when they hit the shelves. They are reliable bloomers, have great color and options in-store or online, and come in bulk packages. Because flowering bulbs often make a bigger impact when planted in a bunch, many gardeners look to buy in bulk. They do sell out quickly, only have a few of the most popular options, and are only available at certain times of the year, often corresponding with ideal planting schedules.</p><p>You will need a membership to shop at Costco, which adds cost to your overall purchase. If you are just in the market for flower bulbs, the membership price is probably too much to make it worth it, even if the bulbs are great. If you’re looking for a variety of plants, patio furniture, garden tools, other home items, or even groceries, a Costco membership may be the right call for you.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/katie-begley-4693290" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Katie Begley</a>, who has grown flowers from bulbs sourced from both big chain stores and small retailers. Her favorite thing to do with flowering bulbs is start them in a container and gift them to friends and family once they have started to grow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Best Earthquake Insurance Providers of 2021</title>

<description><![CDATA[Homeowners in high-risk states need to protect their investment with earthquake insurance. Which company is best?]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/pMhMhE-xCdkiNvD1o9B45YRKQZU=/2121x1414/GettyImages-1183544683-081ffde9f716467c815988cea19e099f.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Earthquake Insurance" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">sefa ozel / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earthquakes aren't uncommon in many parts of the United States. And yet, homeowners often lack coverage when disaster strikes. This is because most homeowners insurance policies do not <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/facts-myths-advice-earthquakes-swimming-pools-2737016" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">cover earthquake damage</a>. Unlike flood insurance, earthquake insurance isn’t mandated by mortgage companies, even in high-risk areas like California. So, it’s up to you to determine if you should spend the extra money to protect your home and its contents from an earthquake.</p><p>When most people think of earthquakes, they think of California. Yet, only 13% of Californians carry earthquake insurance to protect their home in the event of this type of natural disaster.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"></span> And that’s just one state. Every month, we see headlines about earthquakes happening in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, or even Tennessee. Americans who want to protect against these devastating events can purchase separate earthquake insurance policies—also known as riders or endorsements—to existing homeowners insurance policies.</p><p>To help you decide where to find coverage, we reviewed the top earthquake insurance companies based on their financial strength, customer service, and overall product offerings. We considered companies that write separate earthquake policies as well as those that offer riders and endorsements that can be added to existing homeowner coverage.</p><h2>Best Overall: Allstate</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/5FDrBX10b7iies9TjvztKa6eb00=/896x896/66713809_10159112866765329_5641582621541531648_n-08d155f95dc54e3cb4b452b511f67621.jpg" alt="Allstate" width="896" height="896" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Allstate</span></figcaption></figure><p>Awarded an A+ rating by the Better Business Bureau, Allstate has been in business since 1931 and serves all 50 states with home, life, auto, flood, and earthquake insurance.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"></span> The company has an AM Best rating of A+, demonstrating financial stability to get through difficult times.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"></span> In California, Allstate writes coverage through the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), but provides earthquake coverage in other regions, too.</p><p>One of Allstate's benefits is the ability to put all your insurance—including home, auto insurance, umbrella insurance, and flood insurance—under one company, giving you a single point of contact. You’ll also enjoy multi-policy discounts if you write home, auto, and earthquake insurance with Allstate. The company offers other discounts, including claim-free discounts, a customer loyalty discount, and a discount for retired seniors who are 55 or older.</p><p>Allstate has a robust online presence, giving you the ability to manage your policy, pay your bill, make claims, or get a free quote online 24/7. If you prefer to make a claim by phone, the company offers 24/7 live customer service. Coverage levels are comparable to competitors, with maximum coverage up to $500,000.</p><p>Allstate's online presence, in addition to its multi-policy bundling discounts, are why we chose it as the best overall option for earthquake insurance.</p><h2>Best Overall (Runner-Up): State Farm</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/HP04wMxZX13H8DxvtH9h3uVsSTA=/960x960/21729000_10154712866381890_5588392766818406315_o-1-da1cb9972da942769b21f7e7c99a8b55.png" alt="State Farm" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">State Farm</span></figcaption></figure><p>State Farm is known for its better-than-average customer service and provides coverage through a nationwide network of agents. Its earthquake coverage offers protection for property damage and damage to the contents of your home, personal injury, debris removal, and broken glass clean-up. CEA coverage is available for residents of California, but policies are available for residents of other states as well. </p><p>In business since 1922, State Farm has an AM Best rating of A++, signifying its financial stability and ability to pay claims.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"></span> </p><p>State Farm offers multi-line discounts for customers who bundle their home, earthquake, and auto insurance. It also provides a loyalty discount for long-standing customers. If you also have your home insurance with State Farm, you may receive a discount if you’ve gone claim-free for at least five years, with the discount increasing (up to a point) for every year after that.</p><p>These discounts, plus State Farm's nationwide network of agents, are why we chose State Farm as our runner-up.</p><h2>Best for Added Coverage: Amica Mutual</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/PCo7Dk9TuIgH7Cn8i3fb-al1QUU=/640x640/1936684_124521862510_5456946_n-98c08a18aebc4f6ba9e9d335a6867598.jpg" alt="Amica Mutual" width="640" height="640" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Amica Mutual</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amica Mutual is one of the best-known insurance companies providing home, auto, and life insurance to individuals in select states, including California. Unlike many other insurance companies, Amica offers earthquake insurance as an endorsement to a homeowners insurance policy. If you purchase the company’s “Catastrophic coverage” upgrade, you can make claims for property damage caused by earthquakes or floods. However, this does not include the other coverage commonly offered as part of earthquake insurance, coverage for your belongings, or additional living expenses you may have to pay if you can’t live in your home due to earthquake damage. </p><p>Amica’s customer service and overall customer satisfaction are highly rated by J.D. Power & Associates. The company also has an AM Best rating of A+ for financial strength.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"></span> If you live in California, you can write your Amica Mutual earthquake insurance policy through the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) for full coverage. The strength of Amica's earthquake endorsement and the company's high ratings for customer service are why we chose it as the best for additional coverage.</p><h2>Best for Customer Service: Farmers</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/FLci0LGTXrqcURPfNsIrnMWlfgk=/640x640/24796558_1957648504262463_7659493307620746596_n-15a2e10cf16d4fe7a43168b7fad588b9.jpg" alt="Farmers" width="640" height="640" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Farmers</span></figcaption></figure><p>Farmers Insurance achieved a 5/5 rating by ConsumersAdvocate.org, and has been accredited by the Better Business Bureau since 1951, currently holding an A+ rating.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"></span> In business since 1928, the company has an AM Best rating of A (Excellent), showing that it is financially stable and able to pay claims.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"></span> </p><p>The company does not offer a claim-free discount for home or earthquake insurance, but it does offer a multi-line discount and bundling discounts if you also purchase home and auto insurance. You may also be able to save money on your earthquake policy by increasing your deductible; just make sure you can cover the cost of your deductible if you need to make a claim. </p><p>The Farmers website makes it easy to adjust your coverage levels, file and track claims, and make payments online. If you prefer, you can file a claim by phone, with representatives standing by 24/7. Farmers is also renowned for its disaster claims service and may dispatch its Mobile Claims Center to your community if you experience an earthquake. These are the reasons we chose it as our best option for customer service.</p><h2>Best for High-Value Homes: PURE Insurance</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/l9tD9hRqpwB3UdXxUyrIVYEnXW8=/960x960/19092980_1551939324837015_5136532458073614897_o-827be342ccea48929948b40b7bbba48a.png" alt="PURE Insurance" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">PURE Insurance</span></figcaption></figure><p>PURE Insurance, in business since 2007, is best known for insuring high-value homes and vehicles, as well as providing umbrella policies for high-net-worth individuals. PURE writes 46% of the earthquake insurance policies in California through the CEA. Renowned for concierge-level service, PURE <a href="https://www.pureinsurance.com/newsroom/pure-insurance-named-best-high-net-worth-insurance-company-at-the-2019-private-asset-management-awards" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">was named Best High Net Worth Insurance Company</a> in 2019 for the second year running in the Private Asset Management Awards.</p><p>PURE provides more than just insurance coverage; it partners with its members to provide exemplary, personalized service and a host of resources on its website. PURE Member Advocates help you find the resources you need to rebuild or repair your home or replace your belongings if you have to make a claim. The PURE Situation Room keeps members apprised of ever-changing situations that may require action, including impending or recent natural disasters.</p><p>PURE has an AM Best rating of A (Excellent).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"></span> It does, however, have a low B- rating from BBB for failing to respond to two complaints, and is not accredited.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"></span></p><p>PURE also provides “excess and surplus” lines for homeowners in high-risk areas, who may find it harder to get coverage elsewhere.</p><p>PURE's concierge-level service, plus the company's stellar ratings for customer service (especially among affluent clients) are why we chose it as the best option for high-value homes.</p><h2>Best for Bundling for Discounts: American Family Insurance</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/VF6O6Jp5t_cfOwc6JZBQ1PzzGZo=/640x640/1426312_10152080687128428_421966851_n-e08817b77b3548be8000b4a4f56479c4.jpg" alt="American Family Insurance" width="640" height="640" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">American Family Insurance</span></figcaption></figure><p>American Family Mutual Insurance Company offers a full range of insurance coverage, including home insurance policies and earthquake insurance, as well as retirement savings accounts and other financial services. If you’re looking for one company to manage all your insurance and investments, American Family is worth a look. </p><p>American Family has an A rating from AM Best<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"></span> and an A rating from the BBB, although it is not accredited.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"></span></p><p>You can add an earthquake coverage rider to your AmFam home insurance policy. At the most basic level, you can get coverage to rebuild or repair your home and other dwellings following an earthquake, coverage to replace your home’s contents damaged in a quake, as well as reimbursement for additional living expenses you may accrue if your home is unlivable for a period of time.</p><p>You can also save up to 20% on home insurance and up to 29% on your auto policy if you bundle your insurance with <a href="https://www.amfam.com/insurance/home/coverages/home-and-auto-bundle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">American Family</a>. These substantial discounts are why we chose AmFam as the best for bundling.</p><p>The company covers 19 states including earthquake-prone areas like Nevada, Washington, and Utah. </p><h2>Best for California Residents: California Earthquake Authority</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/BtMwhMM9Ikb3tNuqOy_FTJR6pso=/800x800/431382_493614784000141_1591728885_n-10a247fa7d2e4d05abd9ab818d2388c3.jpg" alt="California Earthquake Authority" width="800" height="800" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">California Earthquake Authority</span></figcaption></figure><p>The California Earthquake Authority is a privately funded, publicly managed organization that’s not like other earthquake insurance carriers. It holds 22.8% (the majority) of the market share for all earthquake insurance in California and focuses exclusively on earthquake insurance.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"></span> The company insures over 1 million California homes as of 2020. </p><p>It is important to understand the CEA is not a direct insurance provider. It writes policies through top companies like Allstate, Amica Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and others. CEA may be able to negotiate a better deal for California residents, and you’ll gain access to CEA’s personalized service and wealth of resources. This is why we chose it as the best for California residents.</p><p>CEA works with organizations like the California Office of Emergency Services, the Earthquake Country Alliance, and the American Red Cross to provide resources and assistance to Californians, raise awareness of earthquake risk, and help California residents prepare for the next big quake.</p><p>CEA offers premium discounts for homes and mobile homes that have undergone a seismic retrofit to be more resistant to earthquakes. The organization has an AM Best rating of A-, which is a testament to its financial stability.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"></span> </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How Do I Know If I Need Earthquake Insurance?</h3><p>Earthquake insurance isn’t mandatory, but if you live in a high-risk area, you should definitely consider purchasing it. Although many people think of California as a high-risk area, there are plenty of other states where earthquakes may be a possibility. Do your research to determine your risk before deciding whether or not you need earthquake insurance. If you don’t have enough money saved to rebuild your home, replace belongings, and pay for temporary housing, you should seriously consider it.</p><h3>What Does Earthquake Insurance Cover?</h3><p>If an earthquake damages your home, your insurance will cover repairs to your home and other structures, such as a garage or swimming pool. You’ll also get reimbursed for the cost of damaged property. With loss of use coverage, you’ll also be covered for expenses you may incur if you can’t stay in your home.</p><h3>How Much Does Earthquake Insurance Cost?</h3><p>The cost of earthquake insurance depends on many factors, including your location, age of your home and number of stories, soil type, distance to fault lines, and how much it will cost to rebuild. The price can range from $50 in a very low-risk area to about $3,000 annually for $500,000 of coverage.</p><h3>How We Chose the Best Earthquake Insurance</h3><p>To choose the best earthquake insurance companies, we looked at more than a dozen insurers nationwide. To narrow down our list, we considered insurance providers’ financial stability, online consumer reviews, and the depth and breadth of their coverage. Each company’s overall reputation for home insurance and the quality of their claims service also factored into our rankings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 7 Best Grout Sealers of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/uQSLEQ8-uiW_gM7V_um74OKR4sU=/5700x3800/toothbrush-on-side-of-sink-98844073-5a37d0a35b6e2400370c4403.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[Grout sealers are essential for protecting grout from dirt and germs. We researched the best grout sealers to help you find one for your touch-ups.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grout, which is a mixture of cement, sand, and water, often with color added, serves to fill the gaps between tiles. But whether those tiles are on your floor, kitchen counters, or bathtub surround, one thing is inevitable; eventually, splashes or water or other liquids cause discoloration, mold growth, and damage. There’s a solution, however: grout sealer. Applied annually–or even every six months if the tile often gets wet–you can lock moisture out of the grout, keeping it looking its best far longer.</p><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grout-sealer-definition-1821387" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applying grout sealer</a> is a simple–albeit tedious–procedure, well within the abilities of even a beginning DIYer, and typically accomplished in just a few hours when the right products are used. We’ve made it even easier by researching the many types of grout sealer available and then whittling them down to those that do the best job for various applications around the home.</p><p>Here, the best grout sealers on the market.</p><p>Grout is both decorative and protective, and acts as a filler to cover any space between tiles to form a solid surface. Since grout contains a portion of sand, it needs protection from a sealant to last. Sand is porous, having small holes where dirt and bacteria can remain. The best sealers block these holes as much as possible.</p><p>The Aqua Mix Sealer's Choice Gold Quart takes the top spot for its natural looks and extensive protection. This product is a water-based sealer that provides ample protection over the entire surface, including grout and tiles. It also dries with a no-sheen finish for a natural look. For <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/porcelain-tile-vs-ceramic-tile-1822583" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">ceramic tiles</a>, this will provide additional protection, and can be used with stones such as granite, marble, masonry and limestone. Use this as a pre-grout sealer on your tiles for extra protection in areas such as bathrooms or kitchens.</p><p>Not all budget grout sealers will do a good job of protecting the grout from dirt and germs. While an inexpensive option is a good choice for larger projects or for tighter budgets, you need to be sure the sealer gets the job done. The Black Diamond UGS PT Ultimate is the best choice for this since it’s meant to fight mold and mildew growth.</p><p>The sealer is designed to repel oil and water, which can lead to extensive damage in the grout over time. In places where moisture is common, such as the kitchen or bathroom, this type of protection will reduce the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grout-cleaning-and-maintenance-guide-4048446" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">amount of maintenance</a> your grout and tiles will need after extensive use. The sealer will also repel food, grease, mildew, as well as mold to prevent harmful bacteria from developing.</p><p>The challenge with grout sealers is depth. Since sand is porous, deeper holes need to be addressed depending on the thickness of the grout. Most sealers use a water-based solution that stops near the surface to protect the outer layers. To reach further in, an impregnator like the Miracle Sealants 32-ounce bottle is necessary.</p><p>This sealer uses a solvent-based formula that penetrates deeper into the grout layer. The deeper penetration means extra, longer-lasting protection for the grout and surrounding tiles. The sealer dries into a slip-resistant finish, so it is safe to walk on treated <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tile-cleaning-mistakes-1901117" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile floors</a> without worry. The extra protection will also keep stains from forming, preserving the look of the tile surface.</p><p>Applying grout sealant can be a tricky process depending on the method of application. Bottles require extra time and attention, along with a tool, sponge or rag, to create a solid layer. Spray-on sealers are a great alternative since it is easier to get a level and complete finish over the grout and other surfaces.</p><p>The Miracle Sealants 15-ounce spray bottle uses a consistent pressure spray for equal coverage on the surface. The formula can be applied to grout, concrete, brick and other natural stones (should you want to have a single protective layer over the surface as well). For <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/gorgeous-bathroom-tiles-1822618" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>, you can use the spray inside and out since it will resist the common moisture levels found in outdoor environments.</p><p>Tube grout sealers allow for precise control over the sealant as you work. Since their supply is often more limited than bottles and spray-on alternatives, tubes are best used for small projects or for touching up leftover spots. Over time, you can keep a tube like the Custom Building Products TileLab for spot repairs to keep the sealer intact with extended use.</p><p>The tube contains 6 ounces of sealant, which should last a long time for the occasional touch-up or repair. Once fully dried, the sealer will resist mildew and bacterial build-up, making cleanup in bathrooms and kitchens easier and safer. The sealant also provides stain protection on tiles.</p><p>Larger projects require more sealer to get a quality coat and deep penetration. Gallon sealer bottles are the most cost-effective for this size. With a gallon bottle, you will have enough to finish larger projects up to 800 square feet (and still have some often leftover). You can then store the additional sealer for later touch-ups.</p><p>Tuff Duck’s Natural Stone & Grout Sealer gallon bottle is a multipurpose sealant formula designed for both grout and tile surfaces alike. Being non-acidic, the formula is safe to use on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/guide-to-natural-stone-tile-flooring-1315061" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural stones</a> and concrete to protect the appearance of the surface. For grout, the sealer will penetrate to the bottom so all of the natural pores are covered up for better moisture and bacteria protection.</p><p>Sealant formulas vary depending on the brand and manufacturer. Some formulas are specifically for grout and nothing else. If you have a project where other hard surfaces need protection, a multipurpose sealant like the Black Diamond Granite Sealer may be a good alternative.</p><p>This sealer comes in a 16-fluid-ounce spray bottle designed for small projects or light touch-ups. The formula is non-toxic and non-corrosive, making it safe for granite, concrete, as well as other stones in addition to grout. As a water-based formula, it is also safe for food contact if you want to apply extra protection to things such as <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sealing-and-removing-granite-counter-stains-1822207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">granite countertops</a> in the kitchen. Application is easy: spray and wipe away any excess.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Grout Sealer</h2><h3>Application Type</h3><p>Grout sealer is available in spray-on formulas, ready-to-apply tubes, or larger quart and gallon size containers that require rag or sponge application. Take your pick of how you’d like to apply a sealant to your grout, keeping in mind the square footage you need to cover. While a tube of grout sealer is convenient, it probably isn’t a practical choice for larger jobs. Spray-on formulas help achieve a consistent, even layer of sealant over the surface, but gallon-size containers will offer the most bang for your buck.</p><h3>Water vs. Solvent Based</h3><p>Some grout sealers are water-based formulas, while others are solvent-based. Water-based grout sealers offer more surface-level protection and won’t penetrate as deeply into porous grout, but they also don’t produce as many odors or VOC’s as some solvent-based formulas. For deep protection of your grout, however, a solvent-based impregnator-sealer is the best bet since it’ll fill spaces and protect your grout from deep within.</p><h3>Treatable Surfaces</h3><p>While some grout sealers are intended for grout only, other formulas can be used on cement, granite, and other types of natural stone. Look for a non-corrosive formula to ensure that it won’t damage your treated surface. And if you plan to use it on a food prep or dining surface, like kitchen counters or a bar top, then look for a product that's non-toxic and safe for contact with food.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do you apply grout sealer? </h3><p>While applying grout sealer isn’t difficult, it can be a bit tedious if you have a large area to cover. Still, it shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours at most to get the job done. Always read the specific product application directions before applying sealer, but as a general guideline this is how the job is done.  </p><ol><li>If the grout is new, wait at least 48 hours—72 is better—before applying grout sealer. This gives the fresh grout enough time to dry completely. Otherwise, you could get cloudy or bubbled results. </li><li>If sealing old grout, be sure it’s as clean as possible before resealing it. Otherwise, you’ll trap dirt and stains beneath the sealer.</li><li>Apply painter’s tape to block off and protect any trim, such as baseboards, that you don’t want to wet with the grout sealer. </li><li>Choose your appropriate application tools. If applying the sealer to a large tiled floor, and using a product safe for use on tile as well as grout, it’s fastest to apply the sealer with a sponge mop. But for most jobs, you’ll do best with a small foam paint brush, sponge, or roller. Some products come in applicator bottles with a roller top built right in; this is especially handy for thin grout lines. Aerosol products spray on directly.</li><li>Wet your applicator with the grout sealer, and begin wiping the liquid into the grout lines. If you are sealing both horizontal and vertical surfaces, start with the vertical tile. </li><li>Apply enough grout sealer to soak the grout. Work slowly and methodically to ensure you evenly coat all grout surfaces. </li><li>Wipe excess sealer off the tiles, unless you are using a product meant to seal both grout and tile. </li><li>Let the sealer dry for the time recommended by the manufacturer. This is typically anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour.</li><li>Apply a second coat of grout sealer, following the same general guidelines. </li><li>If the sealer leaves any hazy or white splotches on the tile, dampen a clean cloth with a bit of the grout sealer, and wipe the area until the blotch is gone. Now wipe the tile with a clean, dry cloth to remove any lingering residue. </li><li>Once the grout sealer is completely dry, flick a couple of drops of water onto the sealed surface. If it’s properly sealed, the water should ball into droplets. If the water soaks in, however, the grout isn’t completely sealed and you’ll need to apply another coat of sealer.</li></ol><h3>Do all types of grout require sealing?</h3><p>Not all types of grout need to be sealed. Synthetic-based grouts, such as epoxy or urethane grouts, do not require regular sealing. However, if you want to keep your cement-based grout—the most common type—reasonably free of dirt, stains, and mold spots, you’ll need to apply a grout sealer on a regular basis.</p><h3>How often does grout need to be sealed?</h3><p>Sealing grout isn’t a one-and-done task. As a general rule, you should reseal grout that isn’t often wet—such as walls, floors, and fireplace surrounds—once per year. But for best results, you should plan on resealing grout twice per year in areas that often get wet, such as inside a shower or tub, on a kitchen counter, or behind a kitchen or bathroom sink.</p><h3>How long does it take for grout sealer to dry? </h3><p>While the specifics can vary, as a general rule, grout sealer is dry enough to walk on within 2 or 3 hours of application. However, it can take up to 48 hours for the sealer to cure completely, so wait a couple of days before allowing heavy traffic on your newly-sealed tile floor, taking a shower or bath in a freshly sealed tub, or putting your just-sealed countertops to heavy use.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/michelle-ullman-350447" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Michelle Ullman</a>, the tool expert for The Spruce.

<title>The 8 Best Paint Edgers of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/PwsO3bZ9xYPIkruxSmNlMq33M5o=/5262x3508/young-woman-putting-adhesive-tape-on-a-wall-78269395-585345b73df78ce2c3a8c8f7.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[Paint edgers promise an alternative to cutting-in or painter&#39;s tape. Learn about the best paint edgers to use for walls, trim, and ceilings.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want the most professional results possible when tackling a DIY paint job, you’ll need more than just a paintbrush or paint roller. You’ll also want a paint edger, which allows you to create precise, clean lines along the edges of trim, doors, ceilings, and baseboards without having to use painter’s tape or a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-cut-in-interior-trim-paint-1822824" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">cutting-in technique</a>, which can be challenging for many beginning painters.</p><p>It's important to note, however, that to achieve the best results with any paint edger, you need to take care not to overload the edger with paint and not to get paint on the wheels or edges of the device. Either of these errors will lead to smears instead of clean edges. It's a good idea to practice on a piece of cardboard before using your edger on the wall.</p><p>Although these devices are simple, there are a lot of choices on the market, so we did the heavy work for you by sorting through the best paint edgers available today.</p><p>Here are the best paint edgers for a wide variety of needs.</p><p>One of the biggest annoyances when using a paint edger is dipping the pad into the paint tray and getting paint onto the edger’s wheels, which then track paint onto the wall and spoil your perfect edge. To the rescue: The ingenious and yet simple design of the Shur-Line Paint Edger Pro, which lets you flip the wheels up and out of the way when it’s time to reload the 4-3/4 x 3-3/4 inch replaceable pad with paint. Add to that the smoothly rolling wheels, the single-touch pad ejection feature–no more paint on your fingers–the swiveling handle that attaches to any standard paint extension pole, the ergonomic design that’s easy on your hands, and the soft pad that lays down paint without lint or brushstrokes, and you have a paint edger that helps even a beginner paint around trim, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/additional-coat-of-baseboard-paint-1822391" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">baseboards</a>, and other obstacles like a pro.</p><p>Painting the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-way-to-paint-a-ceiling-1822385" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">ceiling</a> can be challenging, but with the Shur-Line Edger Plus Premium and your favorite sturdy paint extension pole, you can quickly and easily get perfectly cut lines around the edges; no more frustrating spots of paint on the walls. The smoothly rolling wheels won’t catch or skip, and the woven pad applies paint evenly on smooth or lightly textured ceilings. Once attached to your extension pole, the edger easily pivots or swivels as needed, making it a breeze to work your way around air vents or lighting fixtures. The 6-1/2 x 5-3/4 inch replaceable pad is large enough to get the job done quickly, which means a lot less strain on your arms, neck, and shoulders from working overhead.</p><p>Painting high walls presents a predicament: You either need to balance your paint pan on your ladder, or you need to step down to reload the roller or brush with paint every time it runs dry. However, the Wagner Smart Edge Roller eliminates both scenarios, and instead, holds up to six ounces of paint right in the handle, letting you cover up to 96 feet before needing a refill. That means you can work with fewer interruptions, all while creating smooth, perfect lines along the tops of walls, over windows, around trim, or even in hard-to-reach spots over doorways with the 3 x 3/8 inch roller’s built-in edging guides. And once you finish the project, the roller is washable and reusable, so it will be ready the next time you need to paint.</p><p>It can be tough getting a clean, straight line on a textured <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-properly-use-a-paint-brush-1824840" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall</a>. Some foam pad edgers don’t glide smoothly over heavy texture, leaving bare spots that mar your project’s appearance. But missed spots and skips won’t be a problem when you use the Emery Edger Paint Brush Edging Tool, even on heavily textured surfaces. Unlike most paint edgers, this one isn’t a wheeled pad or roller. Instead, it’s a traditional 1-1/5 inch nylon-bristle paintbrush with an attached plastic two-piece edge guard that creates precise lines around doors, windows, trim, and other obstacles. A foam pad between the two halves of the plastic guard keeps paint flowing smoothly over the brush bristles, even on rough surfaces, textured walls, or popcorn ceilings. While you’ll need to replace the pad, you can easily clean the paintbrush and plastic guard for use on future projects.</p><p>Sometimes, all you need is an inexpensive paint edger for a small painting project or to touch up scuffs or other damage on an already painted wall. For those times, the Whizz Painter Edger is inexpensive enough to toss without regrets once the job is finished–although the pads are replaceable if you want to keep the edger for future use–yet it still applies paint smoothly and quickly, leaving no lint or track marks behind. At 3-1/2 x 7-5/8 inches, this edger is larger than most, so you can cover a lot of wall without spending a lot of time. On the downside, you cannot attach an extension pole to the edger, and the small handle is not as easily or comfortably grasped as the handle of other paint edgers featured here.  </p><p>If you’ve ever painted a room, you know one of the biggest <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/rules-for-better-interior-painting-1822836" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges</a> is getting full, even coverage in the corners. Regular paintbrushes and rollers tend to either miss spots or deposit paint unevenly in a corner’s tight confines, which leaves your paint job looking sloppy and unprofessional. Luckily, there’s a solution: The Shur-Line Premium Corner Painter. Instead of the usual rectangle, this ingenious device has a V-shaped head with just enough swivel to easily reach into corners and lay a smooth, neat application of paint without seamlines, gaps, or drips. Attach an extension pole to reach corners way up high or grasp the ergonomic handle when working down low. The edger takes regular 4-3/4 x 3-3/4 inch Shur-Line refill pads, so you can use it over and over again.</p><p>Most paint edgers are flat rectangular pads, which do a fine job, but require slow and careful work. Some painters, however, are in a hurry. If you are one of them, it’s hard to beat the Accubrush MX for creating perfect edges while still keeping up a quick pace. This handy device has a 4 x 2 inch poly-blend roller with a 3/8-inch nap that evenly covers both flat and textured surfaces. But the real secret is in the combination of the plastic side guard and tiny underlying brush that lets the roller glide right along the edges of corners, ceilings, baseboards, and trim without the need for protective painter’s tape, and without smudging paint where you don’t want it to go. Instead, you’ll get a perfect line of paint that would make even a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-paint-your-walls-4160963" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional</a> proud. The rollers are washable and reusable.</p><p>If your ceilings are exceptionally high, you’ll still need to use a stepladder, but with the Mr. LongArm Trim Smart Edger and your choice of paint extension pole, even high ceilings get the perfectly edged lines they deserve. Unlike most edgers, which only have two horizontally aligned wheels, this edger has an additional wheel placed vertically, so you can change directions without having to lift the edger off the painted surface–a major plus when working on a ceiling high above your head. The flocked foam 4-3/4 x 3-1/2 inch pads glide over smooth or lightly textured surfaces and are easy to replace once your project is finished.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Paint Edger</h2><h3>Pad or Roller</h3><p>There are two basic types of paint edger: those with pads and those with rollers. Paint edgers with pads basically smear on the paint; the pads are fabric with a bit of texture, so you dip the pad into the paint and then slide it across the wall.</p><p>Paint edgers with rollers are much like full-size paint rollers; a flocked roller rotates as you move it across the wall. As a general rule, pads are less expensive than rollers, but pads are likelier to leave lines in the fresh paint.</p><h3>Ease of Movement</h3><p>Ideally, your paint edger glides along the wall without catching or dragging. Some have small wheels to make movement very easy, but you’ll need to take care not to get sloppy with your work.</p><h3>Extension Pole Adapter</h3><p>Most—but not all—paint edgers have an attachment point for an extension pole. If you’ll be working up high on the walls or ceiling, this is a must-have, so be sure to check the specifications before purchasing your edger.</p><h3>Size and Shape</h3><p>Most paint edgers are fairly small, but some are larger than others. If you’ll be working in tight corners or on a small stretch of wall, a correspondingly small paint edger is your best choice. If you have lots of wall to cover, however, a larger edger will shorten your worktime. And while most paint edgers are rectangular, you’ll find triangular edgers for tackling corners.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do you use a paint edger? </h3><p>Using a paint edger is not that different from using a paint brush or roller—all apply a smooth coat of paint if used properly—but it’s easier to make mistakes with an edger, leading to smeared or blotchy results. Here are the basic steps to using your paint edger correctly:</p><ol><li>Pour your paint into a tray or plate. You don’t need much; a deep pool of paint will lead to sloppy results. </li><li>Dip just the pad of the edger lightly into the paint. Take care not to get paint on the edger’s wheels; this is the #1 mistake made by DIY painters. Paint on the wheels will track on your wall, leaving paint smears where you don’t want them. </li><li>Gently wipe the edger pad against the edge of your paint tray to remove excess paint. </li><li>Place the edger in position on the wall so the front of the edger is against the trim, corner, or other object you don’t want painted, and roll the edger slowly and smoothly down the wall. Repeat once or twice until you have full paint coverage. </li><li>Reload the paint edger as needed, taking care not to get paint on the wheels or overload the edger.</li></ol><h3>How do you clean a paint edger?</h3><p>If you want to use your paint edger for future painting projects, you’ll need to clean it after each day’s use. </p><ol><li>Start by rinsing the edger pad and holder with clean water.</li><li>Squeeze and work the pad to release paint. Rinse again.</li><li>If paint is still present, add a couple of drops of liquid dishwashing soap to the pad, work up suds by pushing and kneading the pad with your fingers, and then rinse thoroughly.</li><li>Wash off paint on the edger’s holder with your fingers or a sponge. Rinse thoroughly.</li><li>Let the paint edger pad and holder air dry completely before storing or using for another paint job. </li></ol><h3>How long does a paint edger last?</h3><p>The cheapest paint edgers are disposable; use for one paint job and then toss. But paint edgers with replaceable pads can last through quite a few paint jobs if cleaned thoroughly between each use. Note that once the pad becomes frayed, loaded with dry paint, or worn, you’ll need to replace it.</p><h2>Why Trust the Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/michelle-ullman-350447" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Michelle Ullman</a>, the tool expert for The Spruce.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/dEXXq9RMUeFdn8GWeVEhSZnPWro=/2122x1412/GettyImages-532841658-f3bb874bb5db400f997e48d1f04cc009.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="living room with lots of bold colors and objects" width="2122" height="1412" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Andreas von Einsiedel / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Eclectic style is one of those home decor looks that can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. But at its core, eclectic style is all about filling your home with personality. It's fun, funky, and full of visual interest.</p><p>Maybe you can't decide whether your favorite type of decor is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-add-farmhouse-style-4102345" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">farmhouse rustic</a> or mid-century modern. Or you can't stand things that are too "matchy-matchy" or pristine. Eclectic style is a great way to define your home decor when it's a bit of, well, everything.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Though the word “eclectic” has been around for a long time, it has only recently become associated with an approach to decorating. Eclectic-style decor got its start in the late 19th or early 20th century when architectural pioneers prided themselves on the fact that they didn’t adhere to any particular style, then set about doing their own thing.</p><p>However, their work was so successful that their plan appears to have backfired, and these trend-setters actually birthed what became known as the eclectic style of decorating. Eventually, eclecticism morphed from an architectural style to a home decor theme.</p><h2>Characteristics of Eclectic Style</h2><p>Eclectic style is not characterized by rules or structure. It is often created by mixing and matching a few types of home decor looks into one cohesive, purposeful theme. Though there is not a guidebook to easily recreate eclectic style (and the best way is by making it your own), there are a few characteristics that are common to it.</p><ul><li><strong>Mixed patterns: </strong>One hallmark of eclectic style is mixing patterns. Few things match perfectly, but patterns are purposefully combined.</li><li><strong>Global influences</strong>: If you love to travel and explore, eclectic home decor is for you. Often you will find worldly decor and inspiration woven throughout an eclectic home.</li><li><strong>Old and new</strong>: It's typical to mix the vintage and the new in an eclectic home, meshing together different time periods into one beautifully done space.</li><li><strong>Unexpected decor</strong>: While everything may have its place, you will often find unexpected touches in an eclectic home. Think trunks used as a coffee table or clear stools at a breakfast bar.</li></ul><p>Because of this premise, many misinterpret the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-maximalist-style-4685629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">eclectic</a> style as an anything-goes way of decorating, but the true <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/eclectic-designs-4127990" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">eclectic style</a> is actually very purposeful and well thought-out. The look is not about simply throwing things together, but combining decor styles in a way that is fully intentional.</p><h2>Eclectic Style Ideas</h2><p>To inspire your next home makeover, we've rounded up some of our favorite examples of eclectic style in action.</p><h3>Go Wild With Plants</h3><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/sUidRUZd1j6x9WRLzmBfHtCjhoI=/1080x1350/167548023_302163918088888_2709220527237643415_n-30973af3f9a742d5aa3b3b53e9df1c31.jpg" alt="Mid century side board " width="1080" height="1350" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">JC Designs</span></figcaption></figure><p>Eclectic homes often have a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/decorating-with-greenery-4156594" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">lot of greenery</a>.

(This was a few years ago, before my plant journey began). Towards the end of the day vendors heavily discount plants and flowers as they would prefer not to put them back on their trucks. Which is how I ended up with a Calathea as one of my first plants ever. I was drawn in by the 5 pound price tag (and it was a pretty big plant).</p><p>It was dead within two weeks. </p><p>This was how I learned the hard way that <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-calathea-indoors-1902745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Calatheas are high-maintenance plants</a> that are not for novices. They are basically divas and if you don’t give them what they want, they will die. Quickly.</p><p>Needless to say those two weeks were the beginning and end of my experience caring for a Calathea—I’m permanently scarred (I've since grown my indoor calathea-free jungle to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/one-woman-s-amazing-plant-journey-5078860" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">more than 70 plants</a>).</p><p>But, there are better plant parents out there than me who have tried and failed and tried and succeeded with their Calathea. I spoke with Shelley Caruana (@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shelleys.indoor.jungle/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Shelleys.indoor.jungle</a>), who shared four tips for caring for Calathea so yours doesn't end up in the trash like mine.</p><h2>1. Humidity Is Key</h2><p>Shelley has a humidifier running near her Calathea constantly. Ideally you want <em>at least</em> 50% humidity but 60% is ideal. If you don’t want to buy a humidifier you can try grouping plants together, putting your Calathea in a greenhouse (you can buy a dome to cover it to trap humidity if you don’t have room for a greenhouse), or placing a tray of pebbles covered in water underneath it. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/PL1Okxtju5KLySu7yBOaJCBZk14=/1080x1080/processed21-e0b6749d338143e1bcc3d5d594992afc.jpeg" alt="Calathea with crispy edges" width="1080" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">@Shelleys.indoor.jungle</span></figcaption></figure><h2>2. A Watering Schedule Is Way More Important Than You Think</h2><p>Shelley shared an eye-opening tip: Calathea “have really sensitive roots. They will EASILY rot, if overwatered," she said.</p><p>"But! Whilst you should let them dry out between waterings you, leave them an extra day and they immediately start crisping up. I think this is the trickiest part of calatheas and I've learnt to live with having some crispy leaves, better than them rotting and dying completely."</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/EUWW26TbY02rZjsUmMN-3qHEWgI=/1080x1080/processed-59ea6e1a8cdd41848db5faa8c0b92e72.jpeg" alt="The Instagram photo of a Calathea vs the real-life look at the same Calathea with lots of crispy leaves" width="1080" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">@Shelleys.indoor.jungle</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finding the balance between wet and moist soil is really tough so as always stick your finger into the soil up to your first knuckle to see if it needs water (if a lot of soil comes off on your finger, that soil is wet; if your finger is dry, grab your watering can).</p><h2>3. When You Repot, Don’t Loosen the Root Ball Too Much</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/9eCWIRdP210NDaZCLUIcPLwCMS8=/1500x1000/theglowdown-5e6cba7d53744bde81f305e49b2bc7ec.jpg" alt="A dying a calathea. Left: January 2021 and Right: March 2021 " width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption>This calathea went from thriving in January 2021 to dying in March 2021<span class="copyright">@Shelleys.indoor.jungle.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking from her own experience, Shelley said, “They also don't love their roots to be messed with when repotting. Whenever I remove all the soil, they decline before bouncing back.” Instead of taking all of the soil off the root ball when repotting, simply loosen it a bit before moving it to a bigger pot filled with some new nutrient dense soil.</p><h2>4. They Want Light but Not Direct Light</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/rpqmz74nCt02Jycw1Y5aokObavo=/1080x1080/processed4-e4c472f50e1442f4a9cc6cbb13a8abba.jpeg" alt="A Calathea in September 2020 (left) and in February 2021 (right)" width="1080" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">@Shelleys.indoor.jungle</span></figcaption></figure><p>Calathea are often considered a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/low-light-conditions-houseplants-1902917" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">low-light plant</a> but from my own experience (aka sticking it in a hallway that only got three hours of light a day) I wouldn’t stick to this religiously. While they definitely don’t want direct light (it can not only burn their leaves but bleach them too), they do need light to thrive. “If you give adequate light (never direct hit sun, they burn), figure out a consistent and correct watering routine, and provide adequate humidity—you won't have a perfect calathea but you will have a lot of new growth!” said Shelley.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/qsOGBjhxau309MpX9EZhM72LIW0=/1000x667/Stocksy_txp33e12f5dP74300_Small_221193-86ba115c776e413785a7c521361926cd.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="light airy log cabin" width="1000" height="667" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Trinette Reed / Stocksy</span></figcaption></figure><p>When life gets a little crazy, the idea of snuggling up with a cup of coffee and a good book in a little cabin in the mountains or woods can seem like heaven. </p><p>As with any themed decor, matching how you decorate your home with the style of the home itself  works best. However, even if you don’t have an actual cabin, you can incorporate that look—and its serenity—in just about any place you call home. Take a few tips from professional designers to create rustic cabin decor and cozy up your space.</p><p>“The idea of ‘cabin’ is iconic; a way of life that means you have the luxury to get away and enjoy nature, but without being too fancy” says Alecia Stevens, founder of <a href="https://aleciastevens.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Alecia Stevens Interiors</a>. “Fancy is not what a cabin should be. To me, a cabin isn’t about the show; it is about the hearth, some solitude and nature.”</p><p>Here are the five designer-approved tips to make your cabin the perfect getaway.</p><h2>1. Start With Wooden Furniture</h2><p>The foundation of any room is the furniture you choose. And in this case, you want to start with wood.</p><p>“It wouldn't be a cabin with plenty of wood accents,” says celebrity designer <a href="https://bobbyberk.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Bobby Berk</a>. “A live-edge table is a great piece that combines a simple shape with that rustic, outdoorsy vibe.” Berk suggests <a href="https://www.crofthouse.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Croft House</a> for ideas on minimalist wood furniture that would be at home in your cabin.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/fTrU2L7_GECj8wEm0brmweIRsAA=/808x619/Stocksy_txp6f91158cd74300_Small_221431-5207bf6bf51f49158c4854db6af4f925.jpg" alt="wicker and wood furniture in a cabin" width="808" height="619" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Stocksy / Trinette Reed</span></figcaption></figure><p>“We all know that log furniture screams cabin,” says Stevens. “Historically, furniture is made from whatever is available locally, so it makes sense that log furniture is at home in a cabin”  She recommends La Luna Collection, made in Wisconsin, for beautiful and well-scaled log pieces.  </p><h3>But Don't Go Overboard With Wood</h3><p>However, Stevens cautions that more is less with log cabin decor. “A little goes a long way and it starts looking like a cliche,” she says. “I like a cabin that looks like you have collected things over time, so use as many antiques and vintage pieces as you can find.”</p><h3>Other Options</h3><p>If log isn’t your jam, Stevens suggests considering pine and old painted furniture as tables, chests, benches, chairs. “Woven furniture is also great—wicker pieces and rush seated chairs. The most important thing is that it feels organic and natural.” </p><h2>2. Add Carefully Curated Cabin Décor</h2><h3>Kitschy Items</h3><p>There is no shortage of kitschy “Welcome to Our Cabin” signs, bear figurines and canoe bookshelves in the world. And kitschy has its place, definitely setting a cabin scene. Going all in with over-the-top, themed art is more chaos than cozy. Stevens has some ideas on a better way to artfully decorate your cabin in the woods—or wherever it might be. </p><h3>Modest Art </h3><p>“I think art can be almost anything, as long as its character is simple and a bit modest,” says Stevens. “Vintage pieces work especially well in a cabin. Old oil paintings stretched on canvas without a frame, oil on board, watercolors are especially nice and soft, maybe a collection of black and white photos that are relevant to the location.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/WSZGt9LVzw-eSL5s9JBicsciGT4=/988x1244/ScreenShot2021-04-29at11.28.02AM-bf8af825826749b18d474ea7b93697a9.png" alt="kitschy cabin decor" width="988" height="1244" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Ashley Montgomery Design</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Items With a Nature Theme</h3><p>Anything that speaks to nature aligns well with cabin chic. And where to buy cabin decor? Berk says you can find a variety of great wood, ceramic and natural objects and accessories by perusing <a href="https://bloomist.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Bloomist</a>. “Cabin chic is definitely all about creating that super cozy feeling and bringing in lots of natural materials,” he says. “You want pieces to be tailored and have clean lines to elevate the look from your typical cabin. I like to stick to a more nature-inspired palette of shades of white, brown, blues, and greens.”</p><h3>Consider Mixing Decor Styles</h3><p>Vintage isn’t the only way to achieve the cabin look. “I think you could do something amazing and modern - like a large color photo that is a bit eccentric, and make that work, too. And I wouldn’t cross a gilt frame off the list,” Stevens says. “I have a beautiful oil painting of a dragonfly in a true water gilded frame and it would be wonderful in a cabin because of its reference to nature. If you have a lot of art, hang some of it salon style so it has more presence than scattered around the room.”</p><p>In a nutshell, Stevens says all accessories should be natural - things you find when you are out on a hike. “If it was designed in a cubicle - don’t use it!”</p><h2>3. Bring the Natural Materials Into the Kitchen, Too</h2><p>Whether you are decorating a real cabin or making your home an oasis straight from the outdoors, the kitchen is key. It truly is the heart of every home. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/rCF3FhKXrDZvYrg5LoS_ZxaXN0w=/1733x1155/Stocksy_txp00265ee4CTc200_Medium_27590322-f66ad763f797467193401cbcc7ad75e9.jpg" alt="natural kitchen with wooden details" width="1733" height="1155" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Trinette Reed / Stocksy</span></figcaption></figure><p>“For this, I would think about natural materials again—an old table, old wooden bread bowls stacked on the counter, baskets on top of the cabinets, stacks of vintage linen towels in a basket for use, a steel pot rack, copper pots if possible,” Stevens says. “Make it a real kitchen, not a white showplace from the suburbs.”</p><h2>4. Focus on 'Comfort'</h2><p>Cabins are all about relaxing, taking time away from the stresses of daily life and enjoying a little silence and solitude. Or the best facsimile you can create within your four walls. Common areas such as the living room, family room or den have their own requirements. </p><h3>Add Plenty of Lighting (But Not Recessed Lighting!)</h3><p>“I think comfort is essential in a cabin. Light the room with lamps as much as possible as cabins can be dark sometimes—with white or light colored shades to throw the light around the room,” Stevens says. “Task lights are nice for a single person, but won’t light the room nicely. Every chair or seat should have access to light for reading.” She says recessed lighting is a no-no for cabin life. </p><h3>Cozy and Convenient Items</h3><p>Furnish your living areas with actual living in mind by anticipating the way the space will be used. “Make sure every seat has a table nearby to put the coffee or a drink,” Steven says. “ I use sheepskins on my linen sofas  and on some of my chairs. They are super comfortable and look great in a cabin setting. Have a large basket of cozy throws and blankets.”</p><p>Mixing materials can create a relaxed yet intriguing look that gives you the cabin decor you crave, with a personal spin. “Pair natural elements that have an aged look (like stone and leather) with faux fur throws and chunky knit pillows,” Berk says.</p><h3>Focus on Functionality</h3><p>Be sure to focus on the functionality of your rustic features. “Fireplaces should have all the tools needed to make it easy to use—a way to stack wood, carry it in from outdoors in a basket or canvas wood carrier,” according to Stevens. And don’t forget to look down: Your floors add another layer to your design. </p><p>Stevens suggests mixing some old rugs across your space. “Even if they are a little threadbare, don’t be afraid to use them. They will wear like iron.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/o62RQrvhtpRyEwkRSP1Ec4954p8=/928x620/17-Minwawa-4e7686fe672947a5ab01662417879350.jpeg" alt="elements of cabin decor, including antique and sheepskin rugs, original flooring, and task lights" width="928" height="620" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jersey Ice Cream Co.</span></figcaption></figure><h2>5. Highlight the Outdoor Space, Too</h2><p>Cabin decor is popular because it evokes the feeling of being out in nature. So it only makes sense that rustic cabin decor extends into nature itself in the form of decks, patios and fire pits. And the same basic rules apply.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/J9uUHRz-YI67BDe10vbMN6iUtT4=/1571x1048/GettyImages-200420399-001-56d83e7fe4d34a6d95819748f92cec6f.jpg" alt="Weathered teak furniture on a patio" width="1571" height="1048" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Peter Samuels / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Outdoor seating follows the same idea as indoors,” says Stevens. “Use vintage outdoor furniture when possible. It’s not technically ‘outdoor’ rated by today’s standards, but has such a great old look. Otherwise, I would use teak such as the pieces from Kingsley Bate—the old steamer loungers, folding chairs, tables. It will weather to a beautiful old gray and look like it’s been in the family for years.”</p><p>Cabin living requires a certain aesthetic and state of mind. Take a few tips from these designers and create the perfect space to cozy up. </p>]]></content:encoded>

We all have our preferences and tastes that reflect our personalities. While some zodiac signs are well-known for having strong decorating skills, it can be a bit of a different experience for others, like the lively and flamboyant Leo!</p><p>Leo has a contagious energy and charm that draws others in. They have a confidence that allows them to take on any challenge that comes their way, and they aren’t afraid to speak their mind. They enjoy impressing others, but they don’t feel the need to change to accommodate anyone else. So how does this affect the way they decorate their home? Check out the list below for ten things Leo should keep in mind as they start the process.</p><h2>Don’t Hold Back</h2><p>You have plenty of drive and enough confidence to pull off whatever your heart desires–so do it! While some people may prefer to stick to minimalist or contemporary trends, this doesn’t mean you have to follow suit if you want to mix things up.</p><p>Decorating your home should be just as fun as it is practical, so don’t try to force yourself into a style that doesn’t fit you. One of the most important parts of decorating your home is how you feel about it.</p><h2>Orange Is Your Color</h2><p>Every zodiac sign has a power color, and for Leo, it’s orange. Power colors don’t have to be your favorite hue–it’s simply a color that reflects and brings out your best qualities. Given your fiery nature, orange is a perfect fit for you!</p><p>So, whether you decide to paint a wall or add small touches of orange around your home, you’ll benefit from adding this warm tone around your space.</p><h2>Gold Is a Game Changer</h2><p>You’re all about elegance and sophistication, but it can be challenging to know how to upgrade your space if you don’t have much to work with. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/decorate-with-gold-finishes-4156688" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding gold</a> into your color scheme is the perfect way to elevate your home to something more regal.</p><p>From frames, accents, decor, and even textures within wallpaper and fabrics–you can easily add gold to give a royal touch!</p><h2>It's Okay to Show Off a Little</h2><p>You’re ambitious about your goals–when you want something, you don’t stop until you get it. While some people might feel bashful about showing off, you’re proud of what you’ve accomplished, so why not showcase it?</p><p>Whether it’s awards you’ve won, items you’ve created, or statement pieces that reflect your accomplishments, don’t be afraid to make them a focal point when decorating. It’s more than okay to draw attention to those moments from time to time!</p><h2>Merge the Past and Present</h2><p>While there isn’t anything wrong with decorating in the current styles, you have a soft spot for things that are classic and have a history. From antique mirrors to vintage furniture, you love having items that aren’t as easy to get hold of.</p><p>Mixing items from the past with modern decor is ideal for you, so look into <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/decorating-in-the-transitional-style-452459" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">transitional styles</a> for ideas on how to make it happen. There are plenty of ways to take older items and merge them with current items for a fresh take, so give it a shot! </p><h2>Bring on the Bright and Bold</h2><p>While some might choose to go neutral and under the radar with their home design, you’ve never been one to blend in. Your personality is bold and bright, so it makes sense your home would reflect the same.</p><p>Including bright colors and eye-catching patterns will certainly grab everyone’s attention, as well as inspiring you on a daily basis to be yourself!</p><h2>Embrace the Other Elements</h2><p>You love fire sign energy, but that doesn’t mean other influences aren’t needed once in a while. Adding in options derived from the other elements is a great way to refocus and allow different concepts to work together.</p><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/big-leaf-plants-5101252" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oversized plants</a>, wooden decor, or cooler tones in specific spaces can give different vibes throughout your home–and it’s a great way to keep yourself balanced.</p><h2>Lighten Up</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/interior-lighting-design-basics-1313467" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting in your space</a> can make or break so much of your design, so don’t underestimate its importance. Certain colors may clash depending on the saturation of the light, and having stunning decor is rendered useless if it can’t be properly seen.</p><p>If you have access to plenty of natural light, then make the most of it. If you don’t, then finding creative ways to light up your home is a given–from different sizes of lamps or going as extravagant as a decadent chandelier will ensure your home is as radiant as you are!</p><h2>Open Up Your Space</h2><p>When decorating your home, it’s good to remember to organize it to accommodate the guests as you love to entertain. Having an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/decorate-an-open-concept-house-1976650" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">open concept</a> is ideal for you since you need ample space to not feel caged in.</p><p>You might have plenty of stuff, but arranging it where you have some open space is vital. It also doesn’t hurt to focus on creating that space around areas people will gather–such as the living room or the kitchen–instead of the entire house.</p><h2>Maximalism Was Made for You</h2><p>It can be difficult to know exactly where to start when decorating, so taking into account different styles can be a great guide to figuring out what you want.</p><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-maximalist-style-4685629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximalism</a> has become more popular over the years, with its daring and bold concepts and ability to mix and match various styles and patterns. Instead of requiring you to tone yourself down, maximalism encourages you to go over the top with your decor concepts, which is perfect for you.</p><p>Whether you decide to take this route with the whole house, a room, or even just an accent wall, it can be a great way to show off your creative side!</p>]]></content:encoded>

When it comes to wall decor, you can go a number of different routes, whether you opt for picture frames, decals, paint, or tapestries. These days, however, we’re especially loving wallpaper—specifically in mural form. Wallpaper murals add so much welcome color, dimension, and personality to any room and will majorly transform a space so that it looks custom and unique. So what are you waiting for? Add a painted wallpaper mural to your home choice today. Here are some creative ways interior designers used wallpaper murals that set the tone for the space they designed.</p><h2>Cottagecore Cozy</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/M9aH8oVSVIrT5rsjs46jqnvrwSw=/2934x2016/LizCaanbyEricRoth-d6fc8dfc147040e59a0cf0654a3db85b.jpeg" alt="floral wallpaper adorns the walls of this cottagecore bedroom with floral window treatments, fresh flowers, and a floral quilt" width="2934" height="2016" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Liz Caan / Eric Roth</span></figcaption></figure><p>This bedroom by <a href="https://lizcaan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Liz Caan</a> is cottagecore at its finest. Floral prints are abundant; truly, the more the merrier. The floral wallpaper mural helps the well-curated space feel nice and complete, while its lighter tones allow the brightly colored window curtains to really pop. </p><h2>Soothing and Sophisticated </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/QubHKmeudM5zT2RMhmfNDy263sQ=/1534x2048/ErinGatesphotobySarahWinchester-9ea4f38ef6aa484189b01f7f7b1a3198.jpg" alt="a gray tree-themed wallpaper mural sets the tone for this soft white nursery" width="1534" height="2048" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Erin Gates / Photo by Sarah Winchester</span></figcaption></figure><p><br/>Designer <a href="http://www.elementsofstyleblog.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Erin Gates</a> featured a soothing mural depicting an outdoor scene in a nursery project. The white and gray hues add intrigue without overwhelming the space. Best of all, this mural is kid-appropriate without appearing too childlike and therefore will shine in the bedroom for years to come. While pairing white and gray with more traditional blue and white patterns is a bit unexpected, the combination works wonderfully in making a nursery look both sophisticated and timeless.</p><h2><strong></strong>Martha’s Vineyard Maximalism </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/w9IZt3uAI2gAmibThb9PmkZ12p0=/1463x2048/WhiteArrowphotobyWhiteArrow-8e8a963e2e6b4b0fb40fcce396bee413.jpeg" alt="Tropical wallpaper mural by French brand Ananbo, used in a bathroom on Martha's Vineyard" width="1463" height="2048" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">White Arrow</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, Martha’s Vineyard may not be known for its palm trees, but they still make for a fun design element! The beachside bathroom by Thomas and Keren Richter of <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">White Arrow</a> received a tropical touch in the form of this dramatic wallpaper mural by French brand <a href="https://www.ananbo.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Ananbo</a>. Blues and greens are always perfect for the loo, as they evoke a cleansing feel, and this design adds so much oomph to a petite space. After all, who says that bathrooms have to be free of personality?  </p><h2><strong></strong>Peppy Stripes </h2><p>A striped wallpaper mural adds a rainbow-like touch to this young girl’s room by Eilyn Jimenz of <a href="https://www.siredesign.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Sire Design</a>; the pastel hues are cheerful but not overpowering.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/DdpgdY-OnjsGgA46F72_GxNGBBQ=/927x740/SireDesignphotobyGrossmanPhoto-7270f2c4f33447b9a333fc620dff0761.png" alt="A pastel-striped wallpaper mural extends to the ceiling in this young girl's bedroom" width="927" height="740" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sire Design / Grossman Photo</span></figcaption></figure><p>Young ones will find this feature pretty darn cool!

Covering solely one wall with a wallpaper mural is more than ok if you’re wary about committing to an entire room. </p><h2><strong></strong>A Nod to Nature </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ck7PGPfvx6SBjvTUWf0Ts7ThKqA=/1125x1392/PhotoCourtesyofAccentProne-c937f02145fe47ad9eb149f3b229a471.jpeg" alt="wallpaper mural used on the ceiling of a nursery, that also features painted shiplap, wood beams, and a large mirror" width="1125" height="1392" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Accent Prone</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wooden beams are a stunning architectural feature on their own; why not celebrate them even further by adding a touch of wallpaper to really make this special detail shine?

Bright colors contrast wonderfully with these more subdued pieces. </p><h2><strong></strong>Antique Inspired </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/QjfjBmF_SkYO6TKfhNo-sx1xmBA=/1001x1500/MarkLavenderphotobyChrisBradley-dff9028aa3324659a61e206d88ebb5ee.jpeg" alt="Chinoiserie wallpaper adorns a traditional entryway to a home with a Chinese chippendale bench and an antique wood side table" width="1001" height="1500" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Mark Lavender / Photo by Chris Bradley</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chinoiserie, please!

Trees are popular houseplants due to the structural element they add to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/the-7-best-houseplants-for-beginners-4767423" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">living spaces</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/feng-shui-air-purifying-plants-4158078" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">air-cleaning qualities</a> they possess. When you choose an indoor tree, you must consider the light needs of the tree, how much water it will require, and its mature size.</p><p>Here are 20 indoor trees that are popular because of their low maintenance needs, compact size, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/botanical-bedroom-decorating-ideas-4100527" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">visual appeal</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/VuReOQrKuyI8TYtiNPCZP-2VR8o=/1500x1000/best-indoor-trees-4148340-FINAL-5c89636446e0fb000113677a-5bfb6374100c495285e789df223d2f68.jpg" alt="illustration of indoor trees" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/OzU_zy7foAZkMnOA_ib_Hpxufp0=/5816x3878/grow-fiddle-leaf-fig-indoors-1902756-01-b92727e971c043cbb74c79c75a593bc3.jpg" alt="fiddle leaf fig tree" width="5816" height="3878" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Corinne Bryson</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fiddle leaf fig hails from the jungle, so a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-houseplants-for-bathroom-4151160" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">bright bathroom</a> would be the ideal spot for your tree. However, a living room location will also work if you protect the tree from drafts and give it enough light and humidity. Some time outdoors will do wonders for the fiddle leaf fig, so give it a temporary home as a patio plant for the month of June.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, filtered light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>10 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Citrus (Citrus family)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Z-ThxM5osQwIVXTEG8T0qcs6oq4=/1413x2123/Pottedlemontree0GettyImages-1095286868-7f9e3de269ee46ae840e72a347f488aa.jpg" alt="Potted lemon tree" width="1413" height="2123" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">cunfek / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bewitching scent of an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/citrus-photo-gallery-4121783" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">orange or lemon tree</a> in bloom is superior to any room freshening spray you will ever encounter.

A well-lit room goes a long way toward preventing the most common complaint about the weeping fig, which is leaf drop. A room with a large picture window, skylight, or south-facing window is most desirable. Plant your weeping fig in well-drained soil, and only water when the soil surface is dry. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>3 to 6 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Rubber Tree (Ficus elastica)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Y_GTYvM5joQJKUqJKnzwSMI9dbI=/5605x3737/grow-rubber-plant-ficus-indoors-1902755--01-01-58570585adeb43878840c608f115ac2e.jpg" alt="a rubber tree in an apartment" width="5605" height="3737" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Cara Cormack</span></figcaption></figure><p>Native to India, rubber trees produce large, glossy leaves in a dark green hue that pops against pale paint colors. Like most tropical trees, rubber trees like moderate temperatures, a humid environment, and good air circulation without drafts. An optional step for the pampered plant is a monthly leaf wiping session with a damp cloth to remove dust. Fertilize your rubber tree every two weeks during periods of active growth to achieve maximum leaf size. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>6 to 10 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Banana Tree (Musa spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ypgdR9aP1n41slc9dnc1p5bN6go=/3683x4747/GettyImages-74420730-59a1f5e368e1a2001326b1d2.jpg" alt="Banana Tree" width="3683" height="4747" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">DEA/C.DANI/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Giant leaf lovers should look no further than an indoor banana tree to satisfy a desire for lush foliage. Some banana trees, such as the Cavendish, produce fruit while others, such as <em>Musa basjoo</em>, do not. When shopping for an indoor banana tree, seek out dwarf cultivars only to keep their size manageable. Filtered light and regular fertilizing help these fast-growing trees reach their potential. If leaves start to brown or curl, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/controlling-spider-mites-3269371" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">check for mites</a>, which are notorious banana pests. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Between 75 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>6 to 10 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/4-xn9FomUAG2AKm7hyNyZdnKtaU=/3090x3387/home-flower-in-a-pot--araucaria-486072033-5171ce20778344568016d39c8207d727.jpg" alt="Home flower in a pot. araucaria" width="3090" height="3387" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Oksana_Alekseeva / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Around the winter holidays, small potted Norfolk Island pine trees are available as "indoor Christmas trees." But these long-lived indoor trees look great at any time of year. Be aware that these trees can grow to more than 100 feet outdoors, and there is not a dwarf variety on the market. An indoor tree will grow about 2 feet each year, so you will have a few years at least before you'll need to move it outdoors. Bright light, moderate watering, and an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-on-caring-for-houseplants-in-the-winter-1403001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">occasional misting</a> will keep your pine happy. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun; can tolerate shade</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (can tolerate cooler weather briefly)</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>100 to 200 feet</li></ul><h2>Umbrella Tree (Schefflera spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Q7IHGQERjTbMtCah63ifMlMUiAY=/1732x1732/Umbrellatreeplant-GettyImages-1008880100-4ab6838f6a3745838e0f8fc6148ad263.jpg" alt="Umbrella tree plant" width="1732" height="1732" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">PhotoAllel / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>With its attractive glossy foliage, the umbrella tree is a fine choice for homes with little direct sunlight or north-facing windows. These trees require little care, but they are attractive to pests like mites and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-scale-insects-1402693" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">scale</a>, so watch out for them when you bring the tree indoors. Umbrella trees like constant moisture, but do not leave them sitting in a tray of stagnant water. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Above 60 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>4 to 15 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Yucca (Yucca spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Yl93YTLJ6vfZ-W0k0XKo7wqNhn4=/1380x2172/GettyImages-102115081-59a1f68bd088c000110d9bae.jpg" alt="Spineless Yucca Tree" width="1380" height="2172" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sian Irvine / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yucca trees, also called yucca stick or spineless yucca, offer a striking live accent in homes.

Groups of three in a pot with staggered heights look very attractive. Give your yucca tree as much sun as you are able to provide, and do not be afraid to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-prune-houseplants-1902692" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">cut the plant in half</a> if it outgrows its space. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun or<strong> </strong>bright, indirect sun</li><li><strong>Water:</strong> Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 35 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>Up to 10 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Jade (Crassula ovata)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/dSwJFtGfg1SaZAXZrcBOpfg4a9o=/6448x4299/grow-jade-plants-indoors-1902981-01-8f7707a296d3481585008307e61f5655.jpg" alt="a jade plant by the window" width="6448" height="4299" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Leticia Almeida</span></figcaption></figure><p>The jade tree is probably the lowest maintenance indoor tree on this list, making it perfect for beginners and anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to care for houseplants. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-healthy-succulent-plants-1902806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">succulent leaves and trunk</a> of this plant give it a sculptural look in a space. Jade trees even make great bonsai specimens. Just water the plant every few weeks, and keep it by a sunny window. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Four or more hours of direct sunlight daily</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Keep lightly moist in spring and summer; water monthly in winter</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (can tolerate cooler weather in winter)</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>3 to 6 feet</li></ul><h2>Money Tree (Pachira aquatica)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/OjgcYhyjkEwWbEvPFzkMRF5vkMA=/3000x2000/get-to-know-the-feng-shui-money-plant-1275013-4-d933291c97e44b93803e232afce6a58b.jpg" alt="money tree closeup" width="3000" height="2000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Krystal Slagle</span></figcaption></figure><p>The spindly trunk of the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/money-tree-for-the-best-feng-shui-money-cure-1274864" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">money tree</a> lends it to braiding, and that is how many of these trees are sold. The braids will grow with the tree over time, hardening and becoming woody as the plant matures. In spite of its Latin name, <em>Pachira aquatica</em>, the money tree does not like excessive watering and will rot if left in standing water. Make sure your container for it has excellent drainage.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 28 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>6 to 8 feet</li></ul><h2>Lady Palm (Rhapis excelsa)</h2><p>The lady palm is a popular palm specimen to grow as an indoor tree thanks to its ability to tolerate low-light conditions. It also has a slow growth rate, meaning it won’t take up much space in a room. But its fan-shaped, glossy green fronds will still add a tropical feel to any space. Plan to water and feed more during the growing season and back off over the winter. Also, protect your palm from direct sun, as it can burn the fronds.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>Up to 6 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Dragon Tree (Dracaena marginata)</h2><p>The dragon tree can make for a stunning houseplant with its sword-shaped green leaves with red edges. This plant is quite hardy and easy to care for. Plus, it’s slow-growing and adapts well to life in a container. Keep your plant out of direct sunlight, as this can burn the foliage. And be sure not to overwater it, which can cause the leaf tips to turn brown.</p><ul><li><strong>Light:</strong> Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>Up to 6 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Parlor Palm (Chamaedorea elegans)</h2><p>As its common name suggests, the parlor palm has long been grown in parlors and other indoor spaces. It adapts well to relatively low-light conditions, remains fairly small indoors, and adds a tropical vibe to a space with its lush green fronds on multiple stems. In fact, giving a parlor palm too much care is often what damages it, especially via overwatering. These palms also are fairly light feeders and only need a weak liquid fertilizer once or twice during the growing season.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>2 to 6 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Majesty Palm (Ravenea revularis)</h2><p>The majesty palm is commonly seen in nurseries sold as an indoor tree specimen. It’s a very attractive palm tree with large, arching, green fronds on multiple stems. Indoors, it has a slow growth rate, gaining up to a foot per year. These palms can be a bit picky about their growing conditions. They prefer warmth and high humidity, along with lightly moist but not waterlogged soil.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>Up to 10 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Corn Plant (Dracaena fragrans)</h2><p>The corn plant does not in fact produce corn. Instead it grows from one or more thick stems that form long, narrow leaves (like those of corn) at their tops. They make good indoor trees because they grow tall and narrow, meaning they don’t take up a lot of floor space. And they are fairly hardy plants that can withstand less-than-ideal growing conditions. But maintaining a humid environment is key for healthy growth, along with keeping them away from drafts.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>60 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>Up to 6 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)</h2><p>Areca palms are commonly seen as houseplants as well as landscape plants in tropical climates. These palms have a clumping growth habit with many stems much like bamboo. In fact, another common name for the plant is the bamboo palm. They do well indoors by a bright window. Plus, they are slow growers and won't need repotting often. Aim to keep their location humid as dry air can turn the leaf tips brown.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun or bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height</strong>: 6 to 7 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Kumquat (Citrus japonica)</h2><p>Kumquat trees generally take well to growing in containers and even have the potential to bear fruit indoors. The key to success is giving them as much bright light as possible and using a supplemental grow light if you don’t have bright windows. Also, kumquat trees don’t tolerate sitting in soggy soil well, so don’t overwater and use a container with excellent drainage. The trees have dense, glossy, dark green foliage that looks great even if they don’t happen to bear their small orange fruits.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>55 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>6 to 12 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis)</h2><p>Bay laurel’s pointed oval leaves are a common cooking ingredient. And it’s fairly easy to keep this plant as an indoor tree to have its leaves right at your fingertips. Bay laurel has a slow growth rate and takes well to pruning, so you will be able to keep the container plant at your desired size. Use a container that just fits the plant’s root ball, as bay laurel likes to be a little cramped. And make sure not to overwater. </p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun or bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture; let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height:</strong> 4 to 6 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Guava (Psidium guajava)</h2><p>Guava is a shrub or small tree that's native to tropical regions. However, it also can be grown indoors if you can mimic its preferred tropical conditions. Give your plant lots of light, warmth, and humidity. Moving it outside during the warmer months is a good option to get the plant the sunlight it craves. These plants grow from a single or multi-stemmed trunk. They won’t always flower and bear fruit indoors, but their mottled green bark and large green leaves still provide visual interest.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moist but not wet</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>4 to 10 feet (indoors)</li></ul><h2>Ponytail Palm (Beaucarnea recurvata)</h2><p>Ponytail palms are popular indoor trees thanks to their slow growth rate and long lifespan. It can take several years before a young ponytail palm reaches even a few feet tall, so these are perfect plants for desktops and other surfaces. Their narrow, ribbon-like, green leaves cascade down the stem. These plants like as much light as possible and don’t require much care beyond watering every one to two weeks.</p><ul><li><strong>Light: </strong>Full sun or bright, indirect light</li><li><strong>Water: </strong>Moderate moisture, let soil dry between waterings</li><li><strong>Temperature: </strong>Above 60 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li><strong>Average height: </strong>6 to 8 feet (indoors)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

These chairs were actually first designed for astronauts, as the signature reclined position helps to reduce the tension placed on their bodies during space launches. By distributing weight evenly across all pressure points, zero-gravity chairs make you feel weightless. They take the pressure off your spine and can promote circulation in the legs.</p><p>When shopping for a zero-gravity chair, there are lots of variations to choose from, including padded chairs and ones with accessories like cup holders and canopies. Many are designed for both indoor and outdoor use, and some even fold flat, making them suitable for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-create-a-travel-itinerary-2647916" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">traveling</a>.</p><p>We researched some of the best zero-gravity chairs to add to your outdoor or indoor space. Read on for our top picks.</p><p>Many zero-gravity chairs are simply lined with mesh, but if you’re looking for a bit more padding, the Lafuma Futura Air Comfort Zero-Gravity Recliner is the way to go. This chair is lined with the brand’s “AirComfort” seat pad, which is made up of three layers of cushioning wrapped in a breathable, quick-dry fabric that comes in several colors.</p><p>The Lafuma chair has a steel tubing frame that reclines into multiple positions, including the signature zero-gravity position, and its unique suspension mechanism provides a firmer seating area than other chairs.

The stay-cool material won’t stick to your skin, even on hot summer days, and its armrests are contoured for maximum comfort. Not too shabby for a budget pick!</p><p>You’ll be able to keep your drink and other patio essentials within arms reach with the Goplus Zero-Gravity Lounge Chair. It comes with a removable side tray that has spaces for a beverage, phone, and other small items, and the chair itself has an aluminum and steel frame that can support up to 300 pounds. It comes in eight colors, and its fabric is water-resistant and breathable, keeping you from getting uncomfortably warm during the summer. Plus, the chair folds flat for storage and is lighter than most at around 16 pounds.</p><p>If you only have one zero-gravity chair, chances are your family will end up fighting over who gets to sit in it, so you might as well get a set like this one. The Rowell Zero Gravity Reclining Sun Lounger Set comes with two chairs and a matching table, giving you everything needed to set up a comfortable <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/outdoor-patio-ideas-that-inspire-4098569" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">lounge area</a> on your patio—or even to take camping.</p><p>The zero-gravity chairs have steel tube frames with all-weather PVC-coated polyester fabric seats, and each can support up to 220 pounds. The chairs are available in beige or black colors, and each one comes with an adjustable headrest pillow. As for the matching table, it has two built-in cup holders and folds flat for easy storage and unbeatable portability.</p><p>Any <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/camping-activities-with-the-family-1270679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">camping gear</a> needs to be portable, and if you plan to take your zero-gravity chair into the great outdoors, you’ll want a folding model like the Caravan Sports Infinity Zero-Gravity Chair. This budget-friendly chair comes in several colors, and it folds down into a 6-inch form, allowing you to pack it into your car more easily.</p><p>The chair boasts a steel tube frame, and its seat is made from a durable textaline fabric that’s suspended by a double bungee system. There’s an adjustable headrest for comfort, and the smooth recline function locks in any position using the dual-fingertip locking system. The steady frame can support up to 300 pounds, and its fabric is suitable to use outdoors, so you don’t have to worry if it gets rained on while you’re camping.</p><p>One of the major benefits of zero-gravity chairs is that they reduce pressure on your spine, which can provide relief for those with back pain. The Wayfair Padded Reclining Zero Gravity Chair is a solid choice if you’re hoping to ease aches and pains, as it offers an extra-large size and padded surface for extra comfort.</p><p>This zero-gravity chair has a steel frame and weather-resistant polyester fabric, and it can be reclined into any position using its simple locking system.

Both its canopy and headrest can be adjusted to suit your needs, and the side tray includes two cup holders, a phone mount, and a tablet holder. The lightweight design can support up to 250 pounds, and it folds flat for portability.</p><p>The majority of zero-gravity chairs have a similar utilitarian appearance, but if you’re hoping for something a bit more attractive, the Kardiel Gravity Chaise Lounge is as stylish as they come. Its contemporary design features a unique sliding support system that lets you assume the zero-gravity position, and a series of flexible suspension straps hold up the comfortable foam cushion.</p><p>This indoor lounge chair has a powder-coated steel base with a polished stainless steel body frame, and you can choose between several materials for its cushion, including <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/fabric-glossary-clothes-you-wear-2145791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">boucle fabric</a>, patterned cowhide, or plain leather.

Your personal preferences will largely determine which type of materials you find most comfortable in a chair, and help you choose between padded, unpadded, and other styles. You may also want to consider factors such as how breathable the chair's material is and, if you intend to keep it outside, how much heat it retains. </p><h3>Features</h3><p>Beyond making you feel weightless, some zero gravity chairs also come with extras to make your lounging even more comfortable. Some have canopies to shade you from the sun, while others come complete with a side table to hold your drink. If you’re planning to keep yours outside, make sure you choose durable fabrics, and if you plan to take it on the go, opt for one that’s light and easy to fold up. </p><h3>Size</h3><p>You'll want to make sure that your chair fits well in your space, but also that the people who'll use most frequently fit well in it. Many zero gravity chairs are adjustable and fit people of all builds, but those who are on the taller or shorter side should make sure to find one that’s comfortable for them.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/camryn-rabideau-4174123" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camryn Rabideau</a>, a freelance writer who’s an expert on all things home.

<title>The 7 Best Carpet Shampoos of 2021 </title>

<description><![CDATA[A great carpet shampoo removes stains and odors and softens your carpet fibers. We researched the best carpet shampoos to help you find the right fit.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Freshen up any room with wall-to-wall carpeting or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/area-rug-rules-of-thumb-2213430" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">area rugs</a> by choosing the right carpet shampoo to banish odors and spiff up stains. By using a combination of cleaning agents that attract or absorb dirt and odor-causing bacteria, carpet shampoos are a quick path toward softer, brighter <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/comparison-of-carpet-fibers-2908801" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">carpet fibers</a>. They can also often be used to give upholstery a quick clean, but you should always spot test a hidden area first. </p><p>Some carpet shampoos are meant to be used with a machine cleaner for large-scale tasks. These liquid formulas are usually concentrated and require dilution before use. Other carpet shampoos are better suited for quick cleaning of small spills and come ready to dispense—usually in a spray bottle or a bottle with an applicator. </p><p>Folex Instant Carpet Spot Remover has earned plenty of praise for its ability to spot clean stains and we proved it with our product testing. But this wonder spray isn’t limited to cleaning up <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/removing-coffee-stains-from-carpet-1901013" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">spilled coffee</a> or dirty footprints on an occasional basis—it also makes an excellent carpet shampoo. </p><p>You can put the stain-fighting power of Folex to work in any machine cleaner. It’s <a href="https://www.folexcompany.com/machine-cleaning/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">recommended by Folex</a> that you mix one part cleaning solution with four to six parts water, adjusting as needed for your soil situation. Since this carpet cleaner is not soap-based and is non-ionic, there’s no need to rinse after the cleaning cycle is complete and it won’t attract dirt to the freshly cleaned fibers. Keeping a bottle of Folex on hand as a spot cleaner and carpet shampoo is a great way to keep carpets and rugs free of messes large and small. </p><p>Pet stains on your carpet or rug are not just unsightly but can be stinky, too. If you’re dealing with vomit, feces, or urine stains on your carpets or rugs, search out a carpet shampoo for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cleaning-pet-stains-from-a-carpet-1314821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">pet stains</a> specifically—pet stains are <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/protein-based-stains-1901073" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">protein-based</a>, which require enzymes to fight effectively.</p><p>Nature’s Miracle Deep-Cleaning Stain and Odor Remover is a bio-enzymatic formula that aims to eliminate visible stains and capture odor-causing particles. The phosphate-free formula produces minimal suds and can be used to scrub pet stains by hand or you can use it with a water-based carpet cleaning machine.</p><p>Carpeting in your car sees plenty of action—muddy shoes, salty boots, and dirty sneakers are common occurrences. Even with robust car mats in place to protect the carpeting underneath, dirt—or spilled coffee from your commute—can find its way into the fine fibers of your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-car-interior-4775265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">vehicle’s floor</a>. To remedy the issue, reach for a carpet shampoo for cars—like the Turtle Wax Power Out Carpet Cleaner. </p><p>This carpet cleaner for cars is a ready-to-apply formula and includes an attached fine bristle brush to scrub stains. Spray the carpet shampoo onto car carpets or mats, let it sit for at least 1 minute for heavy stains, then scrub with the brush to lift dirt and remove odors. Unlike some carpet cleaners for indoor use, there is no rinsing required with this carpet shampoo for cars. Instead, the final step is to simply wipe the fibers with a clean, dry cloth. </p><p>Get the most out of your carpet cleaner by filling it up with a powerful, effective cleaning solution. Carpet shampoos for machine cleaners are designed to lift tiny particles of dirt and allergens from your carpet fibers with a low suds formula that won’t require excessive rinsing. </p><p>While nearly every brand of carpet cleaning machine produces its own carpet shampoo for use in their machines, the reality is that you can use any carpet shampoo you choose—as long as you follow the manufacturer’s instructions for dilution. OxiClean Large Area Carpet Cleaner is a popular choice as a carpet shampoo for machine cleaners of all brands. The brand’s stain-fighting formula is available for a variety of household cleaning needs, including freshening your carpets, rugs, and upholstery. </p><p>This carpet shampoo has a pH level of 10, which means that it’s alkaline and readily binds to more acidic organic materials—like spilled coffee, greasy spots, or dirt. Keep in mind that you should thoroughly vacuum the carpeted surfaces you want to clean in order to remove any loose debris. Heavily soiled spots or stains may benefit from a pre-treatment. </p><p>Many conventional carpet shampoos rely on cleaning chemicals to do the dirty work. If you’re looking for a greener alternative, consider this eco-friendly carpet shampoo from Carpet Miracle. The formula is biodegradable and non-toxic, which means less worries for the environment. For example, it contains no sodium laurel sulfate or phthalates. Plus, it’s Leaping Bunny certified—a cruelty-free certification for non-animal tested products. </p><p>This product is designed to clean and deodorize and it can be used for spot application or in any water-based carpet cleaning machine. A nonionic surfactant formula means that this carpet shampoo produces low amounts of foam and any residue left behind won’t attract dirt, which is an issue with some carpet shampoos. </p><p>Absorb odors fast with this eco-friendly dry carpet shampoo from Aunt Fannie’s. A recognizable ingredient list, with cleaning agents like baking soda, essential oils, and silica, along with a pleasant scent make this non-toxic dry carpet cleaner an easy pick for a quick refresh. </p><p>Like other dry carpet cleaning products, you sprinkle a light layer of Aunt Fannie’s Carpet Refresher directly onto soiled areas. Then, the product needs at least 15 minutes to do its work before you can vacuum it up. Carpets, area rugs, and upholstered items can all benefit from the odor-fighting power of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/baking-soda-for-a-clean-home-1814734" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">baking soda</a> and the light aromatics of essential oils contained in this safe carpet cleaning formula.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that this powder isn't intended to fight stains—just refresh your carpet and remove odors. Consider it more of a maintenance product to use between deep cleanings to keep your room smelling fresh and clean.</p><p>Stretch your cleaning budget with this affordable carpet shampoo concentrate from Zep. Zep’s hard-working formula removes dirt, stains, and odors—and one purchase will last you a long time. A gallon-sized jug of Zep All Purpose Carpet Shampoo makes up to 25 gallons of carpet cleaning solution. It can be used in water-based carpet cleaning machines, be spritzed onto car carpeting, or spot-treat small stains. </p><p>Zep’s All Purpose Carpet Shampoo contains stain and soil repellents intended to keep your carpet looking cleaner for longer—stretching the time between your carpet cleaning sessions. Whether you have pet messes, food stains, or daily dirt to remove from your carpet or rug fibers, this affordable cleaning solution is ready to take it on.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Carpet Shampoo</h2><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>Most carpet shampoos include surfactants, which reduce the surface tension of liquid and increase "wetness" to penetrate carpet fibers. When it comes to shampoo for carpet cleaners, you’ll also find that ready-made formulas include ingredients that produce minimal soap suds—reducing the need for extensive rinsing, which can saturate carpets and increase drying time. </p><p>When choosing a carpet shampoo for pet stains, it’s also important to look for an enzymatic formula. Using specialized ingredients, this type of carpet shampoo will break down the proteins in the stain responsible for lingering odors in your carpet. </p><p>If you’re looking for a natural or eco-friendly carpet cleaner, the active ingredients will differ from most conventional shampoo formulas. These carpet shampoos use plant-based ingredients and natural enzyme cleaners to lift dirt and banish bacteria. </p><h3>Application Method</h3><p>Most liquid carpet shampoo formulas are designed to be used with a carpet cleaning machine or applied as a spot treatment formula. However, there are also dry carpet shampoos that have a slightly different application method and require extra absorption time to penetrate your carpet fibers.  </p><h3>Machine Compatibility</h3><p>There are plenty of brand-specific carpet shampoos on the market, but keep in mind that it’s not necessary to stick to a carpet shampoo made by the same manufacturer as your carpet cleaning machine. Find a formula that fits your cleaning situation and budget. As long as it’s made for use in water-based carpet cleaning machines, you can use the shampoo with confidence. </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do you use a liquid carpet shampoo? </h3><p>To use a liquid carpet shampoo, first determine whether the formula is intended for direct application to carpets and rugs or if it’s meant to be used in a machine cleaner. In either case, be sure to check the bottle for any dilution instructions before dispensing it. </p><p>For most liquid carpet shampoos applied directly to carpets or rugs, the basic directions for use include even application of the product, gentle agitation (with your fingers or a brush), and blotting with a clean microfiber cloth or rag. </p><p>When using a liquid carpet shampoo in a machine cleaner, you should follow the formula’s instructions for dilution. Dispense the amount of shampoo required into the machine’s tank and follow the manufacturer’s directions for use. </p><h3>How do you use a dry shampoo? </h3><p>Using a dry carpet shampoo is a simple four step process. First, vacuum the carpet to remove large debris. Second, sprinkle the product across the area to be cleaned and use a brush or comb to lightly work the product into carpet fibers. Third, allow the product to rest to absorb odor-causing bacteria. The specific wait time will vary according by product, but most formulas require 15 to 30 minutes to work effectively. Finally, use your household vacuum to suck up the dry shampoo and enjoy freshers, softer carpet under your feet.</p><h3>How often should you shampoo your carpets?</h3><p>While professional carpet cleaning is typically recommended on a yearly schedule, there are less specific rules regarding how often you should shampoo carpets yourself. Lifestyle factors, including whether you have kids and pets, if you wear shoes in the house, and how prone you are to spills and stains, will be the largest factors in determining how often your carpets are due for a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-deep-clean-carpet-4846968" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">deep clean</a>. </p><p>While more may seem better, keep in mind that excessive shampooing of your carpets can lead to a buildup of soap—which might actually attract more dirt. So save your suds for when the carpet is beginning to look dingy or in the event of a mess that requires more thorough cleaning. </p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>Delivering spot-on advice and the latest innovations in cleaning products and technology, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/erica-puisis-4174129" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Erica Puisis</a> has been researching home products for The Spruce since 2017. During the days of housetraining a puppy or to deal with spills and stains on wall-to-wall carpeting, a bottle of Folex Instant Carpet Spot Remover is an absolute necessity in her cleaning closet. It’s her go-to product for a carpet shampoo and spot cleaner in one. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Electric blankets pump out heat to keep you <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/items-to-make-your-home-feel-cozy-4628306" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">extra cozy</a> whether it's in bed or on the couch. We've scoured the market for the best electric blankets out there—all at a variety of price points and in an array of styles.</p><p>Here, the best electric blankets on the market now.</p><p>If you’re not sure if you’ll like an electric blanket, you may not want to splurge on a high-end model—instead, consider the Sunbeam Heated Throw Blanket. This affordable heated blanket is on the smaller side, but it’s a good option for occasional use or those testing out the technology. </p><p>This heated blanket is designed to be used as a throw, and the ultra-soft fabric is made from polyester. It uses ThermoFine technology to deliver even heat, and the controller has three different settings to choose from. The blanket automatically shuts off after three hours, and if it gets dirty, you can simply clean it in the washing machine and dryer. This blanket is the perfect size to use on the couch, and you'll love how <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hygge-for-small-spaces-4157913" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">soft and cozy it is</a>. </p><p>Curl up on the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-couches-4150654" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">couch</a> with the Sunbeam Reversible Sherpa/Mink Heated Throw. This super-comfy electric blanket has sherpa fabric on one side and (faux) royal mink on the other, and it has three temperature settings so you can choose your ideal warmth. </p><p>This throw blanket is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/guide-to-buying-blankets-350480" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">ideal for couch use</a>, as it measures 50 x 60 inches, and it features a three-hour automatic shut-off function. It can be cleaned in the washer and dryer, and its ThermoFine warming system senses and adjusts to provide you with consistent warmth. According to reviewers, this blanket is undeniably plush and cozy, but some do say you can feel the wires through the fabric.</p><p>If you're willing to spend a little more for the best heated blanket, you’ll get more features and better performance. In particular, the SoftHeat by Perfect Fit Low-Voltage Heated Blanket delivers a better user experience thanks to its super-fine wires and gentle heat—however, it has a higher price tag to match. </p><p>This fleece blanket uses low-voltage technology, which makes it safer for pets and if it ever gets wet. It’s available in <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/determining-comforter-size-you-need-4089202" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">twin, full, queen, and king sizes</a>, as well as a variety of plain colors, and the larger sizes boast dual controllers so you can share it with a partner. You won’t even be able to feel the thin wires as you lie under this blanket, yet it still delivers cozy, consistent heat.</p><p>If you're looking for a more decorative option that won't look out of place draped over an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-use-accent-furniture-1391610" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">accent chair or sofa</a>, we love this faux fur electric blanket from Beautyrest. It's made from soft polyester and features a patterned fur design on one side and plush fleece on the other, so you'll feel extra cozy when curled up on the couch. The blanket offers three heat settings with a two-hour auto-shutoff feature for safety.</p><p>This stylish electric blanket measures 50 by 60 inches and you can choose from six shades, including chocolate, burgundy, and sapphire blue. For an electric blanket that doubles as decor, you can't go wrong with this cozy and chic option.</p><p>If you're looking for a patterned blanket to keep you cozy, this electric heated blanket from Micro Fleece is a pretty option. Available in blue or green floral print, the soft blanket features flannel on one side and sherpa on the other, and it has down-alternative fill. There are ten heat settings with a "quick heat" feature that reaches maximum heat within 30 minutes, then drops down to your desired temperature. There's also a programmable timer for up to 12 hours and ten-hour auto-shutoff for safety.</p><p>The twin and full sizes come with a single controller, while the queen and king sizes have dual controllers. In addition to the floral prints, this blanket also comes in a striped pattern and solid shades like rose and Wedgewood blue.</p><p>If you're looking for a more decorative option that won't look out of place draped over an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-use-accent-furniture-1391610" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">accent chair or sofa</a>, we love Hyde Lane's Heated Faux Fur Throw Blanket. The faux fur microfiber is soft to the touch, and it has a wavy texture that mimics the look of real fur. The low-voltage wires aren't visible on the surface of the throw, which is a big plus if you plan on displaying this blanket, and the silver remote is small and discreet looking.</p><p>This heated throw blanket comes packaged in a beautiful box, so it's perfect for gifting. The blanket heats up fast and the three heat settings are comfortable and warm—but not overly hot. Choose from six different color options including wild fox and snow leopard.</p><p>One common complaint about heated blankets is that you can feel the wires when using them—it kind of feels like you’re wrapped up in a fishing net. If you hate this feeling, you may want to consider a product like the Serta Soft Heat Low-Voltage Heated Blanket, which features super-thin wires that are nearly undetectable during use for a more comfortable experience. </p><p>The high-end Serta Heated Blanket uses low-voltage wires that are safe in the presence of moisture and for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/remove-pet-hair-from-clothes-2146741" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">pets to sleep on</a>. You can choose from twin, full, queen, or king sizes, and the larger options come with dual zones for customizable heat. The micro-plush fabric is soft and cozy to the touch, and the thin wires are designed to provide even heat distribution without being bulky. </p><p>If your feet tend to get chilly, you can keep them extra warm with the Beautyrest Foot Pocket Electric Blanket. The roomy blanket is made from soft polyester fleece and features a pocket where you can tuck your feet while lounging on the couch or in bed. There are three heat settings with a two-hour auto-shutoff timer, and a pre-heat feature lets you warm up your bed before getting in for the night.</p><p>This cozy blanket is machine washable (just remove the controller before washing) and it comes in four colors: gray, indigo blue, ivory, and tan.</p><p>Don’t like having a heated blanket on top of you? Then you might prefer a heated mattress pad, like this one from Sunbeam. This quilted mattress pad comes in twin, full, queen, and king sizes, and it fits onto your mattress, helping to soothe sore muscles and keep you warm throughout the night. </p><p>This heated mattress pad has dual controllers on the larger sizes, making it ideal for use with a partner, and it comes with ten heat settings. It has a ten-hour automatic shut off, and the skirt fits onto mattresses up to 18 inches deep. It comes with a preheat setting, and the mattress pad is helpful for reducing sore muscles and other aches and pains. It may even allow you to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/warm-up-winter-bedroom-without-heat-4118291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn down the heat</a> in the winter, saving energy while staying warm in bed.</p><p>Want to warm up no matter where you are? The Cozee blanket features a rechargeable battery that provides at least five hours of heat on one charge, so you can bring the blanket along when you leave the house. The blanket has a weather-resistant exterior shell that'll withstand wind, snow, and light rain, and the micro-plush interior is super soft and warm. What's more, the blanket has space-grade Mylar insulation to help reduce heat loss.</p><p>The cordless blanket offers three heat settings (low, medium, and high) and there are two USB ports so you can also charge your phone while you stay warm. Best of all, the blanket is machine washable—just remove the battery pack and you're good to go.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Electric Blanket</h2><h3>Material </h3><p>If your heated blanket is warm but scratchy, you may not enjoy using it as much. Fortunately, many heated blankets on the market now are made with soft microfiber fabrics that feel cozy to the touch or sherpa-style blankets that are fuzzy and warm. In addition to the comfort, the big upside to these polyester microfiber blankets is that most are machine washable for easy care.</p><h3>Size </h3><p>Consider whether you want an electric blanket for your bed or just for lounging around the house. A comforter-size electric blanket, while practical for sleeping, may overwhelm your couch or sitting space, while also being less energy efficient. There are many heated blankets the size of your average throw blanket available. On the other hand, if you want an electric blanket to warm your whole bed, there are all sizes from Twin to King on the market.</p><h2>Standout Features</h2><h3>Dual temperature control</h3><p>If you’ll be sharing your electric blanket with someone else, it makes sense to look for a version that has dual temperature control. This means that you and a fellow snuggler will each have control over half the blanket so that no one is too hot or too cold. Dual temperature controls are becoming more common, but typically cost more than single temperature zone versions.</p><h3>Pre-heat option</h3><p>If you want your bed to be toasty warm before you get in, choose an electric blanket with a pre-heat option. This will ensure the bed has reached your desired temperature before you tuck in for the night.</p><h3>Rechargeable battery</h3><p>While most electric blankets must be plugged in during use, you can opt for a rechargeable battery-operated version if you want the flexibility to get cozy anywhere. This design is pricier, but if going cord-free is a priority, it's worth spending more on your new heated blanket.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was edited and researched by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cristina-sanza-4796434" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristina Sanza</a>, a lifestyle writer specializing in home products and organization hacks.

Whether you’re trying to read on your patio or enjoy lunch by the pool, an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-before-buying-patio-umbrella-2736863" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">outdoor patio umbrella</a> can help solve these woes, offering <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/shade-ideas-for-your-yard-4134671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">protection from the sun</a> while you enjoy the nice weather. </p><p>Patio umbrellas come in all shapes and sizes—round, square, rectangular, and more—so you’ll want to consider what type of umbrella best suits your needs before you buy. Oh, and if you don’t already have an umbrella base, you’ll need one of those, too!  </p><p>To help you find the best outdoor patio umbrella, here are the best options to add to your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/enjoy-outdoor-patio-all-year-round-2736339" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">outdoor space</a>.</p><p>Whether you’re hoping to cover your pool lounge chair or outdoor dining table, the Abba Patio 9-Foot Umbrella has you covered—literally! This umbrella has a 9-foot circular canopy made from durable polyester fabric, and it’s mounted on an iron pole that’s 1-1/2 inches in diameter and features a crank system and push-button tilt, allowing you to quickly adjust the angle of the umbrella to best block the sun. </p><p>The Abba Umbrella is available in several pretty colors, and its canopy is UV-, water-, and fade-resistant for long-lasting durability. It’s supported by eight steel ribs that keep it steady, even on windy days, and there’s a vent at the top of the umbrella to allow airflow. When the umbrella is closed, you can use the sewn-in velcro straps to secure it shut. </p><p><br/>Patio umbrellas can get pretty pricey, but the Pure Garden Aluminum Umbrella is a great value, especially considering its size. Its round polyester canopy is a whopping 10 feet in diameter, allowing you to easily cast shade over a table or seating area. The umbrella is mounted on a powder-coated aluminum pole that’s 1.9-inches in diameter, and the best part is that the canopy can be tilted to help you stay in the shade. </p><p>This patio umbrella comes in a range of bright colors to suit <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-improve-your-outdoor-decor-3955245" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">your style</a>, and the top of the canopy is vented for better airflow and wind resistance. A crank handle can be used to raise and lower the canopy, and despite its reasonable price, the Pure Garden Patio Umbrella is well-built and attractive, making it an ideal option for any outdoor space.</p><p>You’ll be able to cover a huge area with the Le Papillon Market Outdoor Umbrella, which is a whopping 15 feet long! This unique product looks like three standard umbrellas were merged together, and its extra-long design is ideal for providing shade over a long <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/outdoor-dining-spaces-the-best-design-tips-and-tricks-4121195" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">outdoor dining table</a>. The canopy is controlled by a standard crank, and there are three vents along the top of the umbrella to allow improved airflow and increase its stability in the wind. </p><p>Given its large size, it makes sense that the Le Papillon Umbrella is mounted on an oversized pole with a 1.89-inch diameter. (This may not fit in all tables, so be sure to measure before you buy.) The umbrella also requires a special base, which you’ll have to buy separately.</p><p>Keep the party going after dark with the Best Choice Products Lighted Patio Umbrella, which features 24 solar-powered LED lights on the underside of its canopy. The umbrella has a 10-foot diameter and stands 96 inches tall, and it’s mounted on an aluminum pole that’s 1-1/2 inches in diameter. The product comes in a wide range of colors, and the canopy is made from UV- and fade-resistant fabric for durability. </p><p>The Best Choice Products Lighted Umbrella has a push-button tilt system, and it opens and closes via a convenient crank handle. However, the main appeal of this umbrella is obviously its built-in lights—there are three bulbs on each of the eight ribs, and the panel needs around six hours of direct sunlight to charge them up.</p><p>A lot of patio umbrellas are only available in solid colors, but if you’re hoping to add a pop of interest to your outdoor living space, the Frontgate Outdoor Market Umbrella is a high-quality option that’s available in a wide range of fun patterns. The Sunbrella canopy can be decorated with colorful stripes or bold floral patterns, and you also have the choice between an aluminum or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/clean-teak-furniture-1900563" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">teak frame</a>.</p><p>This market umbrella has a 9-foot canopy with a vent on top, and the performance fabric resists fading, stains, mold, and mildew. If you choose an aluminum frame, there are several finishes available, and the pole will feature a classic crank, but the teak frame is equipped with a double-pulley opening system. With either choice, the pole has a 1-1/2 inch diameter that will fit into most umbrella bases.</p><p>For a high-end, durable umbrella that you’ll be able to use for many years, you won’t be disappointed in the L.L. Bean Sunbrella Market Umbrella. Unlike many umbrellas available today, this product has a solid wood pole and wooden ribs that are not only extremely sturdy but attractive, as well. The umbrella has a 9-foot diameter and stands 100 inches tall, and it’s available in a handful of classic colors. </p><p>In addition to its wooden construction, the L.L. Bean Market Umbrella is covered with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-outdoor-umbrellas-2146926" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy-duty Sunbrella fabric</a>, an acrylic material that’s fadeproof and mildew-resistant. The top of the canopy has a skirted top to protect it from gusts of wind, and you can easily raise or lower the umbrella using the inner pulley system.</p><p>An unexpected gust of wind can send your patio umbrella flying across the yard, so to save yourself the hassle of chasing down a rogue canopy, you may want a product like the EliteShade Market Umbrella. What makes this patio umbrella special? Its 9-foot canopy has a unique three-tier design—sometimes referred to as a double wind vent—allowing more air to pass through the umbrella and preventing it from being tossed around in the wind. Plus, it will help to keep you cool on those super-hot days.</p><p>This umbrella comes in a dozen colors, all of which are made from Sunbrella performance fabric. The canopy is supported by an aluminum pole with a 1-1/2 inch diameter, as well as eight powder-coated ribs. There’s a push button that allows you to tilt the umbrella in any direction for more precise shade, and the covering can be opened and closed via a convenient crank handle on the pole.</p><p>Most patio umbrellas don’t come with a base, so you’ll need to buy one separately (if you don’t already have one, that is). While it is priced higher than many other options, the Shademobile Outdoor Umbrella Stand is by far one of the best umbrella bases you can buy, as it’s incredibly sturdy, well-built, attractive, and portable. </p><p>The heavy-duty base features a unique design that allows you to insert bricks into the bottom of the unit, increasing its weight up to 125 pounds for unbeatable stability. It also has heavy-duty hidden wheels that lock into place, allowing you to easily change the location of your umbrella, and it can fit umbrella poles between 1-3/8 and 2-1/16 inches in diameter. Plus, the Shademobile base comes in three finishes to match your outdoor decor.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Outdoor Patio Umbrella</h2><h3>Size</h3><p>Patio umbrellas come in a wide range of sizes—some cover just a single chair, while others are large enough to cover a table for four or more. A 5-foot umbrella is suitable for four people and a 7-foot umbrella provides enough shade for six. If you need something to accommodate eight or more, consider an 11-foot umbrella. </p><h3>Mechanism </h3><p>There are three different options for lifting an outdoor patio umbrella: manual, crank, and pulley. Manual umbrellas require a little more work to lock the canopy into place and can be challenging for shorter people to operate. Crank umbrellas are easier to operate by turning a lever. Pulley umbrellas are the most convenient—simply pull a rope to raise and lower the canopy.</p><h3><strong>﻿</strong>Fabric </h3><p>Sunbrella is the most popular material for outdoor patio umbrellas because it’s durable, as well as stain- and weather-resistant. Other commonly used material includes canvas, acrylic, polyester, and olefin.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/camryn-rabideau-4174123" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Camryn Rabideau</a>, who is a freelance writer and product tester for The Spruce, The Spruce Pets, and The Spruce Crafts.

But when they’re not in their countryside family home or their townhouse in London, Emma and her crew escape to their 2,600 sq ft beach house in St. Mawes in Cornwall––England’s stunning coastal county, forming the country’s southwestern tip.</p><p>“We first acquired our lovely home in St. Mawes in 2010. We have always loved Cornwall and absolutely adored this home’s stunning sea-view location, and saw great potential to reconfigure the existing space to work for us as a family.</p><p>“We did a lot of work when we first moved in,” said Emma of the home which was built in 1910. “We knocked down some of the walls in the entrance hall to create a larger space that sets a light, breezy and welcoming tone for the rest of the home.</p><h2>Style</h2><p>It was important to Emma that they pay homage to their coastal surroundings without leaning into a full Cornish theme. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/BSNHynuFajzrTHoNYEJwdN_fV40=/1332x2000/SimsHilditchCornwallHome4-9757af61a6b744a7aa499a9fdc236d02.jpg" alt="Entryway storage in the Cornwall home of Emma Sims-Hilditch" width="1332" height="2000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p>“One way that we threaded notes of coastal aesthetic through the home is by placing my daughter Daisy’s paintings of the Cornwall scenery around the cottage, and simple prints of classic sailing yachts in the bedrooms. I also included accents of red throughout, particularly in the sitting room where the spines of red books peek out of the bookshelves. The resulting effect is one of romance and relaxation, which is perfect for a coastal home.”</p><h2>Yard and Garden Features</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/hBMHGVg0ytbuo2ku6_X-aURp_yE=/6000x4211/SimsHilditchCornwallHome9-394e7403f0aa4198ac37e2c8d7eb28aa.jpg" alt="Emma Sims-Hilditch's patio furniture at her Cornwall home" width="6000" height="4211" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p>The home features a garden with a terrace dining space and a view of the sea.</p><p>“The temperate climate allows us to grow some amazing plants, including a banana tree! We created a cloud hedge along the boundary of the garden, beyond which you can see the sea. We have a lovely terrace which is perfect to congregate with family to dine al fresco when the weather is nice. One of my favorite things in the garden is a tumbling rosemary hedge that grows really well in our garden. I also adore the lovely wisteria that climbs up the side of the house.”</p><p>“There was also a sweet little summer house in which I could envision a studio to work in, or to simply enjoy a cup of coffee.”</p><h2>The Kitchen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/fVOHC0lgeYrtXiPQm82REHaa070=/6000x4004/SimsHilditchCornwallHome6-1036890aa580484f83c15e2015b0165c.jpg" alt="The kitchen in the country of Emma Sims-Hilditch's seaside vacation home in Cornwall" width="6000" height="4004" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this home, storage and organization are key.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/mXYwtAUxxYEKxuMc9hdpC_HUrnM=/5404x8107/SimsHilditchCornwallHome3-5bd823adbe5a4cb280ddd7721fda0a0e.jpg" alt="Emma Sims-Hilditch dining storage" width="5404" height="8107" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p>“I love how the storage is so well organised in this space,” said Emma. “I have a wonderful spice drawer which helps me to keep track of what I have in a very smart way and a brilliant pantry cupboard which stores all of my dry ingredients and jars. [There’s] even [space for] the equipment which might otherwise sit untidily on the counter, like weighing scales.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/zO7lgh9h-2cB_wnc03BvzRlcnDM=/5344x3563/SimsHilditchCornwallHome4-564f231516e74929b0817983dc21eb3a.jpg" alt="Recessed storage in the dining area/kitchen of Emma Sims-Hilditch's Cornwall home" width="5344" height="3563" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Flooring</h2><p>The floors throughout the home are “a collection of natural materials.” </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/gtMglO7wTdFz0Yx0a_HpfTL_ORA=/8107x5405/SimsHilditchCornwallHome2-9453f306769b40f69351d52a568ac809.jpg" alt="Emma Sims-Hilditch's living room in her Cornwall cottage" width="8107" height="5405" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p>“For every Sims Hilditch project we undertake, we consider a property’s natural surroundings, and this will often influence our design choices,” explained Emma. “In St. Mawes, we are surrounded by beautiful scenery and have tried to bring some of this into the interior through the use of wooden flooring and sisal carpets.”</p><h2>Windows</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/_JHBj3FBwXljcxbHcaNVSohCXak=/2000x1334/SimsHilditchCornwallHome3-780b267641a44a41838cc817feb01185.jpg" alt="the view of the sailboats from the top floor bedroom of Emma Sims-Hilditch's Cornwall cottage" width="2000" height="1334" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>“</strong>The view of the sea was a major pull” when it came to selecting this home, but there’s one spot in particular with the best view. “The view of the distant headland is visible from the first floor. [That] was certainly a factor in our decision to convert the attic into our bedroom.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/QEyUPa81Sfl1txd7E7hBIfj6MnQ=/2000x1377/SimsHilditchCornwallHome1-cdb9a19afffb491e921e052ccb1548f6.jpg" alt="Natural light flooding the living room of Emma Sims-Hilditch's Cornwall cottage" width="2000" height="1377" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Emma Sims-Hilditch</span></figcaption></figure><p>But even in rooms without a sea view, the windows create a special ambiance. “This home is blessed with large windows which allow natural light to flood the home, creating a fresh and calm atmosphere which is key to a coastal property or holiday home.”</p><h2>Bathroom Features</h2><p>The bathroom has been very carefully designed for efficiency. “Designing this bathroom was a bit of a challenge because of the pitched ceiling,” said Emma. “But it was well worth the effort to create an architecturally interesting and bespoke space that I adore.</p><p>“My husband and I managed to design a bath, vanity, console table, toilet and shower into our quaint en-suite bathroom through careful spatial planning, making this room very much a family effort which is special in itself,” said Emma. “I love the fact that the floor is covered in pebbles in homage to the property’s beautiful seaside location, and the shower is surprisingly spacious and fully tiled with handmade tiles by Malborough Tiles," she said.</p><p>“[Tongue-and-groove] on the walls pays tribute to the country style for which Sims Hilditch is known, and a big window sill gives space to decorate and style the room.” </p><h2>Specialty Rooms</h2><p>“We recreated a staircase that leads upstairs to what was once the attic, which we converted into a beautiful bedroom, bathroom, and dressing area," said Emma.</p><p>"The space itself isn’t huge, so I had to be clever with storage. I created a small dressing area and recessed the cabinets into a void in the roof pitch to make use of the space which would otherwise have been wasted. We included light sensors in the wardrobe, and I opted for shutters on the window of the bedroom to accommodate the pitch in the ceiling—curtains or blinds simply wouldn’t fit and blinds work well with an English coastal aesthetic in mind.”</p><h2>Ceilings and Walls</h2><p>"We also applied a v-groove boarding to the walls in various rooms and a rough boarding on the ceiling, which creates texture and a charming ‘not too new’ effect’. We replaced all the doors in the house with a classic design and turned our hand to installing intelligent storage solutions throughout, such as recessing shelving into walls and a hidden cupboard below the stairs.”</p><h2>Favorite Piece</h2><p>“We have a bowl in our sitting room filled with little pebbles on which our cherished friends and family wrote messages to my husband and I for our 25th wedding anniversary. Special touches like this add heart to a home, making it a truly special place.”</p><h2>Extra Special Details</h2><p><strong>“</strong>I created a lovely picture wall made up of family photos and hung it up the stairs to the bedroom to bring the family into the home and personalize the space.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Even if you only have a tiny speck of outdoor space, if you have some sun, you can grow herbs. Most herbs grow well in <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-herbs-in-pots-getting-started-3876523" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">containers</a> and some (like mint and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/herbs-for-a-lemon-scented-garden-1762048" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">lemon balm</a>) should be grown in pots because if you grow them in your garden, they will try to take over. Also, many are pretty forgiving and even beginners can grow them with success. I grow herbs for cooking and decoration as well. I will often put herbs in mixed garden pots because they can add great fragrance and texture.</p><p>The following list contains some of my favorite herbs to grow in pots.</p><h2>Parsley</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/hJ5lkKgCQJ4X1dRy0oUWQ8n5kL8=/4752x3168/high-angle-view-of-plants-688059611-e242f374eace41138d0be37bee158a55.jpg" alt="Potted parsley" width="4752" height="3168" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Kristin Oldenburg / EyeEm / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Almost any recipe is better if you put parsley in or on it (okay, perhaps not chocolate mousse, but you get my point). <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-parsley-1402629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsley</a> is exceedingly easy to grow. You can either buy seedlings, almost anywhere that sells plants or grow it from seed. I usually buy seedlings because the seeds can take weeks to germinate and are fussy about transplanting. If you do start with parsley seeds, soak them overnight before planting.</p><p>Parsley comes in two types: Italian, also called flat parsley, and curly parsley, which is the more common variety. Many people prefer flat parsley for cooking and curly parsley for garnishes. I’ve never been able to tell the difference in taste. Parsley prefers full sun but can grow in partial shade. It’s very hardy and will make it through a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-freeze-fresh-herbs-1403399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">frost</a>. I’ve even found perfectly usable parsley under a few inches of snow. To harvest, just snip off at the base of a stem. As with most herbs, the more you harvest, the more you’ll get.</p><p>Parsley is biennial, which means that it can come back for two years, though some think the leaves are more bitter the second year.</p><h2>Mint</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/fQthSmb5ElOVzHgg85OLuISRWag=/1588x1059/growing-mint-1402628-crop-35227263e23846c5a52ead04bbb0fbdc-a15eb073f308413fa5951995263b44f7.jpg" alt="mint growing in a pot" width="1588" height="1059" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Kara Riley</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mint makes a perfect container herb. Some mints spread so fast and aggressively, that keeping them in a container is the only way to prevent them from taking over your garden. Also, many varieties of mint are beautiful and make a great addition to a decorative planter. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-mint-1402628" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mint</a> is an incredibly easy plant to grow—hence its ability to take over the world.</p><p>Mint likes full sun, but most will tolerate some shade. Some, like spearmint, can be very tall and leggy and some are low spreaders, so make sure to check your plant tag.</p><p>Mint will thrive and get bushy if you keep it <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/garden-maintenance-and-primer-1402475" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">pinched back</a>. As a bonus, mint roots easily from cuttings.</p><p>I particularly like pineapple mint, with its <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pictures-of-variegated-leaves-4069716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">variegated leaves</a> or apple mint or chocolate mint. When I make iced tea, I add handfuls of mint while it is steeping. You can also <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-herbs-for-tea-4151170" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">make an easy tea</a> (also called a tisane) by simply pouring water, just after it has boiled, over the leaves and steeping for a few minutes. Spearmint makes a particularly delicious tea.</p><h2>Oregano</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/L6UrwE60pdS5kNquLNvB_0ilHy4=/4368x2912/oregano-herb-104676273-de3b5d86e4f94129a9ed1a1c0d5437f2.jpg" alt="Potted oregano" width="4368" height="2912" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">marilyna / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/herb-profile-oregano-1761786" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">oregano</a> in container gardens. The leaves are beautiful and it is a plant that thrives on neglect. Oregano loves sun, and not too much water or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/make-your-own-fertilizer-1388159" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">fertilizer</a>. Pinch back regularly to keep the plant compact and to keep it from blooming. Oregano is a perennial that you can either grow overwinter in a cool place or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-oregano-plants-1402818" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">propagate from cuttings</a>. Try golden oregano or Greek oregano for culinary uses and '<a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=251325&isprofile=0&" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Herrenhausen</a>' or ‘Kent Beauty’ for great flowering.</p><p>I often use oregano in mixed containers. It spreads nicely and goes with almost any other plant.</p><h2>Basil</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/iTR6bZbFIBEzF5sIjL1cD3ATF2w=/3862x2575/five-great-herbs-to-grow-in-pots-848223-basil-00fa8c2b89af495296451b9858051d40.jpg" alt="harvested basil next to a potted basil plant" width="3862" height="2575" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Candace Madonna</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-basil-in-containers-848215" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Basil</a> can be a bit temperamental. It is easy to start from seed, but is fussy about temperature; it gets depressed if the thermometer dips below 50 F. If you live in a cold climate, don’t attempt to put basil out early. If you are as impatient as I am, you can also put it in a small enough pot and bring outside during the day and inside in the evening. I also put my pots on carts and drag them in and out of the garage until temps warm up.</p><p>Basil also doesn’t like to be crowded and needs plenty of air circulation to be happy, so give each plant plenty of space. Basil gets cranky if its leaves stay wet, so water carefully. Try to let the soil dry out a bit between watering, but not to the point where the plant wilts. When your plants are about six inches tall, pinch them back so they will grow full and bushy. Make sure to keep harvesting and pinching back for the best production.</p><p>After you pick basil, never refrigerate it as it turns black and icky. Either use right away or make into pesto and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-freeze-fresh-herbs-1403399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">freeze</a>. You can also put branches in water.</p><p>You don't want to let basil flower, because it will get bitter afterward, so keep using it or pinching it back.</p><p>I like Genovese basil for <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/delicious-and-easy-garlic-scape-pesto-848204" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">pesto</a>, 'Siam' basil for Asian recipes, and lemon basil for garnishing drinks. Large-leafed basil like 'Mammoth' or curly basil are great for sandwiches. 'Spicy Globe' has tiny leaves and is a compact bushy plant and is gorgeous and looks beautiful in a small pot. There are also several purple basils that are tasty as well as beautiful and look great with cut flowers.</p><p>Basil is very easy to root in water.</p><h2>Rosemary</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/4JBdMaP64h6mrBCL71vF-X671Yg=/5243x3495/a-bracken-in-a-vase-is-placed-on-table--1028882890-87fe57b8e20d4d0db72071f1d80d7c34.jpg" alt="Potted rosemary" width="5243" height="3495" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Wichean Singwern / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>I find that <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-and-care-for-rosemary-plants-1403406" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">rosemary</a> is one of the most interesting and stunning herbs to put in a pot. Its stiff and spiky texture is gorgeous and the smell just can’t be beat. I have seen hedges of rosemary grown in pots, which are beautiful and incredibly fragrant. There are two types of rosemary—upright and creeping. Both are lovely and tasty.</p><p>Rosemary needs full sun and well-draining soil. Let it dry out a bit between watering, but don't let it dry out completely. If you live in an area above zone 9, (where temperatures stay above 20 F), chances are good you can grow rosemary outside year-round.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 8 Best Tool Bags of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/-_1k_lOLCtJs8oByYfH5Uyf1k4Q=/2121x1414/GettyImages-699094467-5c1a688d4cedfd0001217387.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[A great tool bag has just the right compartments for all your essentials. We researched the best tool bags so you can pick the perfect one for you.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once you have a collection of tools, you need someplace to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/organizing-your-tools-2648069" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">stash them</a>. For some people, that means a toolbox. For others, it’s a tool bag. While the choice ultimately comes down to preference, there are quite a few reasons you might prefer a tool bag to a box.</p><p>Tool bags are lighter, which is a major issue if you carry your toolset with you while working. Plus, they take up less space than a bulky box, another big issue for those with limited storage space. And many DIYers like being able to easily see and grab tools as they need them, which a tool bag makes easy.</p><p>Of course, tool bags come in a variety of sizes and styles. Some have multiple pockets, which makes it easy to organize your tools. Some are open in design, while others have zippers or fasteners to close the pockets. Some have frames, and others are soft. Some are geared towards specific professions or types of tools, while others are general purpose. And finally, there are tool bags made of different materials, including leather both real and faux, nylon, polyester, and canvas.</p><p>To simplify your decision, we researched the top tool bags available today, and then whittled the choices down to best in various categories. Here are our favorite tool bags.</p><p>For a large, durable tool bag that checks all of the boxes, we love the Custom LeatherCraft 1539 Multi Compartment Carrier. This polyester tool bag can handle all of your tools and it won't stretch out or break.</p><p>A spacious inner compartment serves up space for power and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-tools-for-remodeling-1822745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">hand tools</a> that can be awkward or bulky. The large exterior compartments unfold to reveal 50 pockets for bits, handheld screwdrivers, and other tricks of the trade that can get lost in the bottom of a cavernous bag. The zippered side panels give you extra storage space and you won't have to worry that something will fall out. Plus, the padded should strap will help prevent back and should pain, especially if you tend to carry heavy power tools.</p><p>If all you need is a lightweight tool bag to keep your tools organized and near at hand while you work, then there’s no need to break your budget for a pricy bag with all the bells and whistles. But that doesn’t mean you have to settle for something less than you’d like. The WORKPRO 16-Inch Wide Mouth Tool Bag has a lot of great features for such an inexpensive bag, and it’s sturdy enough to last for years if treated properly.</p><p>Made of rugged 600-denier polyester, with a rigid plastic base and padded sides, this is no flimsy bag that will tear easily. It has a sturdy internal metal frame to provide extra support and prevent sagging or drooping, even when heavily loaded with tools. The frame also holds the “mouth” of the bag wide open when desired so you can easily grab what you need without having to root around inside the bag.</p><p>There are pockets galore–13 on the bag’s exterior, eight on the inside, and an additional eight belts to secure wrenches, pliers, and other <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/basic-household-tool-kit-1976251" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">long tools</a>. Padded handles and an adjustable shoulder strap make the bag easy and comfortable to carry, and a double top zipper keeps the whole thing securely fastened when not in use.</p><p>The bag measures 16 x 11 x 8 inches.</p><p>If you're constantly moving from one location to another, a tool bag that has wheels might be the best pick for you. While it's not exactly lightweight (it weighs 19 pounds), this tool bag has a reinforced metal frame and can store up to 100 pounds of tools, making it one of the most durable rolling bags on the market.</p><p>This tool bag has a ton of pockets to keep your tools organized, and the wide mouth cavity allows you to store bulkier items such as <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-use-a-power-drill-1825112" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">power drills</a> and extra tool batteries with ease. Plus, the bright orange interior makes your gadgets super easy to find. No longer will you waste your time searching for tools in a dark bag. Other notable features include a telescoping handle and oversize wheels, which allow this rolling bag to handle rough terrain and rain-slicked surfaces.</p><p>This well-designed, very comfortable, durable tool bag provides easy access to all different kinds of tools–not just those used for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/the-essential-steps-in-building-decks-2130882" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpentry</a>. It may be more expensive than other options on the market, but it's big enough to hold all of your tools and it will last for years.</p><p>It's crafted from high-density neoprene and commercial nylon and has a leather FatLip that runs around the bag to keep the structure from sagging. The ample interior has 24 pockets for a wide variety of tools and a 10-inch deep main bag for larger items. The deep pockets allow you to store sharp tools easily, so you can grab them quickly and won't have to worry about snagging the tool on the bag’s material or punching a hole through the seams.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/when-is-a-plumbing-permit-required-2718700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">plumber </a>or other service technician has to be able to multitask, and so should his tool bag! For a plumbers bag that checks all of the boxes, we recommend the Veto Pro Pac Tech-LC Tool Bag. It has convenient storage options and an ergonomic design that's comfortable on the back and shoulders. It's the perfect choice for electricians, HVAC technicians, plumbers, or anyone else who needs to tote a large collection of tools to multiple work locations each day.</p><p>This tool bag is made from 100% denier nylon, which has a thicker weight and more substantial weave. It has 53 pockets with ample room for bulkier tools, and eight smaller pockets perfectly sized for drill bits and extensions. With numerous compartments (some are even zippered), it makes it easy to find what you're looking for so you don't waste time fumbling in your toolkit.</p><p>The Custom LeatherCraft Carpenter’s Tool Backpack provides a unique solution for technicians, installers, and carpenters who need to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choosing-the-right-type-of-ladder-1824929" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">climb ladders</a> while still having easy access to their tools. It allows for hands-free tool access, whether you're on a roof, ladder, or ledge.</p><p>To organize your tools there are two main compartments: one compartment for smaller tools and a larger compression pocket that is able to fit bulkier tools like a cordless drill. The Custom LeatherCraft bag has padded back support and shoulder straps that make carrying the bag easy on your body. Finally, dual handles at the top make it easy to grab and go.</p><p>When you're working in a dim setting, having a lighted tool bag can illuminate your workspace and help you find the tools you need to get the job done. The Klein Tools Tradesmen Pro Organizer Lighted Tool Bag is a great option, as it has a removable LED light that can be positioned to face inside or outside the bag.</p><p>Not a one-trick pony, this bag has other convenient features. There are 14 internal pockets and 17 external pockets that can hold items you reach for frequently. Klein designed this relatively lightweight bag with 1680D ballistic weave and an orange interior that helps your tools stand out. The molded base protects it from water and gives it a sturdy position in precarious places, such as on a ledge, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/top-roof-repair-and-maintenance-tutorials-4058145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">roof</a>, or ditch.</p><p>Loaded with storage options and lightweight, the DEWALT Electrician’s Tool Bag was built for the hardworking <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/inside-electrical-service-panel-load-center-1824663" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrician </a>or handyperson who needs a constant stable of tools at the ready. Measuring 11 inches long x 10 inches deep x 17 inches high, the bag has a total of 23 pockets, sleeves, and slots to make organizing and carrying your necessities a breeze. There’s even an 8.5 x 6-inch multi-compartment plastic tool tray to sort and hold small items like screws, nuts, and bolts.</p><p>The padded nonslip shoulder strap and carrying handle are easy on your shoulder or hand. But best of all, the box-shape, stable design of the bag means that it stands upright and open on its own, making it easy to find what you need when you need it without fumbling or frustration.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Tool Bag</h2><h3>Material</h3><p>Most tool bags are made of nylon, canvas, or polyester, as these are all lightweight and reasonably strong. You’ll also find tool bags made of leather, but keep in mind that these bags weigh quite a bit more than their synthetic counterparts. A rubber or heavy plastic bottom on any bag is a nice feature, as it helps prevent moisture from seeping into the bag when sitting on the ground, plus it provides stability to keep the bag sitting upright.  </p><h3>Storage Options</h3><p>There are tool bags that are little more than a basic pouch and others that provide multiple zipped and open compartments, clips, belts, and pockets. Consider how many tools you plan to carry, how easily you want to access them, and where your tool bag will be stored when deciding on the type and amount of storage options you need.</p><h3>Comfort</h3><p>The best tool bags have padded shoulder straps and handgrips so you can tote them without discomfort, even when the bag is full. A wide-mouth opening is another nice feature, as it makes it easy to grab what you need quickly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having the best tool for the job can make a huge difference in your ability to do improvement work, and to do it right. After all, you don’t want to go through all the trouble to plan your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-renovate-a-house-1822429" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">home renovations</a> and DIY projects, just to find that you can’t quite get there with your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/basic-household-tool-kit-1976251" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">basic household kit</a>. But the truth is, tools can get expensive—especially compact power tools that are easy to hold and use yet still deliver the power you need, which is why we looked for the very best tool deals.</p><p>If there’s a decent amount of home improvement work in your future, keeping an eye out for tool deals will help you snag what you need when the price is lowest—so you don't totally blow your renovation budget. Sometimes, you can find even better deals when you buy in bundles with batteries, charging stations, and more.</p><p>From drills and impact drivers to oscillating tools, nail guns, and more, these are the best tool deals you can find right now.</p><p><strong>Normally $169, Now $99 </strong></p><p>There’s nothing fancy about this impact driver, which makes it a great go-to option when you just want something that does its job reliably. The 20-volt driver can produce up to 1,400 inch-pounds of torque, but is still small enough to fit into cramped spaces. It also comes with a handy charging station so you’ll never run out of juice.</p><p>The lowest price we've seen is $95.</p><p><strong>Normally $100, Now $82</strong></p><p>You get a drill and an impact driver with this duo. They use the same battery and charging station, which makes this a great value. This is the lowest price we've seen.</p><p><strong>Normally $129, Now $122 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dremel-MM50-01-Multi-Max-Oscillating-Accessories/dp/B07PJVJY5D?tag=thespruce-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Dremel-Multi-Max-MM50-31-Piece-Corded-5-Amp-Variable-Speed-Oscillating-Multi-Tool-Kit-with-Soft-Case/1000796208" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Lowe's</a></strong></p><p>This lightweight tool has a powerful 5-amp motor and a variable speed of 10,000 to 21,000 opm that lets it consistently cut and sand through both thick and thin materials. The front end is compact, so it can fit into tight spaces, and the body is slightly angled, giving you good control on detailed projects. Lowe's offers the same price, but it's only if you use their Advantage Card to complete the purchase.</p><p><strong>Normally $159, Now $122 at<a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DWE575SB-Lightweight-Circular-Electric/dp/B007QUZ16A/?tag=aboutcom02thespruce2-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"> Amazon</a> </strong></p><p>The top-notch laser guide built into this 15-amp saw makes it your best choice for cutting long pieces of wood without accidentally veering off course. A built-in dust blower keeps your line of sight clear, and a trigger-sensitive electric brake makes it easy to stop the blade quickly and efficiently.</p><p><strong>Normally $219, Now $182 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FAU8FOS?tag=aboutcom02thespruce-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=5115096%7Cn54eed67a41ed43f398b1520289c9a8e719" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a></strong></p><p>If you’re looking for a heavy-duty cutting tool, this one is a great pick. While most oscillating tools are 12 volts, this cordless one has 20, allowing it to slice through everything from sheetrock to wood to metal. This kit comes with 28 accessories, and the quick-change lever makes it quick and easy to swap between different blades.</p><p>The lowest price we've seen is $170.</p><p><strong>Normally $181, Now $161</strong></p><p>With 52 accessories, a powerful 3-amp motor, and a depth and cutting guide, this oscillating tool kit is a proper toolkit workhorse. The quick-change system makes it easy to move from cutting to sanding without missing a beat. Yes, there’s a cord, but at 10 feet, you’ll still have enough flexibility to move around without feeling restricted.</p><p><strong>Normally $32, Now $15</strong></p><p>If you’re looking for an even more affordable (and non-electric) way to sharpen a chainsaw, this eight-piece file kit has everything you need to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-sharpen-a-chainsaw-5074172" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">do it manually</a>.

The set comes with an interchangeable battery and a charging station, so you can switch from one tool to the next seamlessly.</p><p>This is the lowest price we've seen.</p><p><strong>Normally $199, Now $159</strong></p><p>One of the best things about this Dewalt driver and drill set is that both tools are pretty compact, making them great for projects that require accessing small spaces. The driver is extremely powerful, too—it can produce up to 1,700 inch-pounds of torque and has two speed settings. The set comes with not one but <em>two</em> batteries, and a charging station.</p><p>The lowest price we've seen is $151.</p><p><strong>Normally $219, Now $179 at Amazon</strong></p><p>It doesn't get much more convenient than a set of four tools that all recharge on one charger. This combo kit includes a 20-volt cordless drill with a 1/2-inch chuck and two variable speeds; a 20-volt cordless impact driver with a 1/4-inch chuck and 1,460 inch-pounds of torque; a 20-volt circular saw with a 6.5-inch blade spinning at 4,200 rpm; and a pivoting LED task light with 140 lumens.</p><p><strong>Normally $129, Now $85 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-PS31-2A-12-Volt-Lithium-Ion-Batteries/dp/B003BEE2LU/?tag=aboutcom02spruce2-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a></strong></p><p>This drill is absurdly light, weighing in at just over 2 pounds, and has a 7-inch head that makes it convenient for squeezing into small spaces. Yet it’s still powerful enough for many DIY jobs, with a maximum speed of 1,300 rpm and 265 inch-pounds of torque. The kit includes two batteries, which stay charged for longer than many comparable drills on the market.</p><p>This is the lowest price we've seen.</p><p><strong>Normally $139, Now $99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dewalt-DCG412B-Lithium-grinder-Tool/dp/B007NVSS1W/?tag=aboutcom02thespruce2-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a></strong></p><p>The cordless design makes this powerful angle grinder very portable and versatile.

<description><![CDATA[Whether you have a shade garden area or your whole yard doesn’t get much sun, this list of best shade-loving flowers will suit you perfectly.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/r_v553MbNWHYWW17Lx_5LdK9AN0=/3227x2151/_flowering-shade-garden-1315940-1-ffb34cfa05034fa3bb578dfe8340e788.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="pink astilbe" width="3227" height="2151" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Autumn Wood</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ample sunlight is essential for many flowers to bloom, but there are some shade-loving flowers that are perfect for a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/shade-garden-ideas-4165708" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">shade garden</a>. These plants can handle a spot that doesn't get <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-full-sun-partial-shade-1402372" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">full sun</a>, and they will still bloom with dazzling, vivid colors. Plus, many of these shade-loving flowers come in a wide variety of colors and other characteristics. Some of the plants grow relatively large while others stay petite and close to the ground.</p><p>Here are 20 of the best flowers for shade.</p><h2>Coral Bells (Heuchera spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/-gNsxWqnDQjNnL9M_VGaRzwMh24=/1000x750/Heuchera-Usage_Chelsea_Scotland_2011-3-56a301a53df78cf7727b7a8f.jpg" alt="Heuchera" width="1000" height="750" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">National Garden Bureau</span></figcaption></figure><p>Blooming in the summertime, coral bells come in many shades of flowers and foliage. The leaves are traditionally green but also can be purple, gold, and more. These flowers can grow in full sun, but they prefer partial shade. Too much light can burn the foliage. However, make sure not to overwater them, as shady, damp conditions can cause disease. </p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>4–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties:</strong> Red, pink, coral, orange, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Hydrangea (Hydrangea spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/vfzmTXDTuZAJpEUChCZVLqDhL6c=/640x512/shadeFieldOutdoorSpaces-56a2ff425f9b58b7d0d0080b.jpg" alt="Hydrangea" width="640" height="512" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Field Outdoor Spaces</span></figcaption></figure><p>Hydrangeas are a favorite among gardeners for their variety of flower colors and appearances. Some bloom in large, round clusters, and others have a smaller, flatter appearance. Hydrangea species tend to do quite well in the partial shade under tall deciduous trees (i.e., trees that lose their leaves in the winter). Too little light will reduce their flower output, but too much sun and heat can wilt the plant. Ideally they should get morning sun followed by some shade in the afternoon. Make sure to give them some extra water on particularly hot days.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>5–9 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties:</strong> White, blue, green, red, pink, purple</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Well-drained</li></ul><h2>Astilbe (Astilbe spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/uBTASXs9wddIRik-zffkb5PSty4=/2121x1414/GettyImages-185004666-5c63949446e0fb0001ca8e57.jpg" alt="Pink Astilbe" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">LordRunar / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>The secret to cultivating a thriving astilbe is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/bog-garden-flowers-1315907" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">water and lots of it</a>. These plants must never dry out, so a site near a pond or stream is ideal. Astilbes are slow-growing and produce plume-like flowers on stalks above the foliage in the spring and summer. They do best in partial shade but also can tolerate heavier shade. However, they likely won’t achieve their maximum size in full shade.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones:</strong> 3–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Pink, red, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Loamy, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Impatiens (Impatiens spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/hkEdTUDA0wNmNVdrYLTh_e4r_ro=/640x426/shadeGregoryGarnich-56a2ff423df78cf7727b73d6.jpg" alt="Caladiums and Impatiens" width="640" height="426" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Gregory Garnich</span></figcaption></figure><p>With their brightly colored blooms in a multitude of hues, impatiens are popular annual shade-loving flowers. There are dozens of species in this genus, but the most commonly grown ones remain under a foot tall. They flower in the spring and summer. These plants will bloom to their fullest potential even in heavy shade, and too much light can wilt them. So if your impatiens are in a sunny spot make sure to give the plants extra water.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>10–11 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Red, pink, violet, coral, purple, yellow, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Bleeding Heart (Lamprocapnos spectabilis)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/zQwOxnCZdFpeDrZuODCMO48_aKY=/5011x3341/bleeding-heart-flowers-in-springtime-531191210-4f586070ca214d03aa3ef20df5e6978d.jpg" alt="Bleeding Heart Flowers in Springtime" width="5011" height="3341" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">skhoward / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bleeding heart blooms in the spring with arching stems of heart-shaped flowers. Even though they are some of the best flowers for shade, these plants will tolerate some sun in cooler climates. However, too much sun and heat can interfere with flowering. In addition to shade, select a planting site that’s protected from strong winds as the flowers are delicate. Also, when watering make sure to keep the soil moist but not soggy.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>3–9 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties:</strong> Pink, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/p0F-u3RFJxFazkg9CZSuukP8Po8=/2121x1414/rhododendron-bush-blooming-in-spring-1165770483-e74c4c2d2aca44fd8884645f7b1add42.jpg" alt="Rhododendron bush blooming in spring" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Marcus Lindstrom / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-do-you-plant-under-trees-2131837" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Gardening under trees</a> isn’t always easy due to the shade and competition with tree roots for soil moisture and nutrients. Where many other plants would die under the cover of trees, rhododendron species thrive. These flowering shrubs bloom in the spring to early summer, and their root system doesn’t like to be exposed to heat. Thus, planting them in a shady spot is ideal. Adding some mulch around your shrub also will help to keep the roots cool and retain soil moisture.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>4–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Pink, lavender, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Pansies (Viola x wittrockiana)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/PH8YuBPemFMBFyJL36RHHWvinq8=/640x427/shadeToruWatanabe-56a2ff435f9b58b7d0d00811.jpg" alt="Pansies" width="640" height="427" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Toru Watanabe</span></figcaption></figure><p>With their large, multicolored, flat flowers, pansies are a harbinger of spring for many gardeners. They appreciate cooler temperatures, blooming in the spring to early summer. Some plants might repeat bloom in the fall. While pansies grow in full sun, too much light and heat can prevent them from flowering to their fullest potential. So a spot that gets partial shade is best to keep them blooming for as long as possible.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>7–11 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>White, yellow, purple, blue</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Lungwort (Pulmonaria spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/NXqdx3hK91NzyIVrsrSSx_D-hD0=/2121x1414/GettyImages-975684594-5c638d46c9e77c0001d93288.jpg" alt="Pulmonaria; Lungwort Plants" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">speakingtomato / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>A nice attribute about pulmonaria, or lungwort, plants is they spread steadily but not invasively over the years to form a large colony. These plants bloom early in the spring when most other plants are just barely waking up from the winter. The blooms are bell- or funnel-shaped and grow in clusters. Lungwort prefers to grow in partial to full shade, but it also can tolerate more sunlight when the weather is still cool. Too much light can burn the foliage while too much shade can minimize flowering.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>3–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Pink, violet, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Fuchsia (Fuschia spp.)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/jjSje2B2DhSKsm1XXcK5xuJlTRE=/3264x2448/GettyImages-645917005-5c638e3346e0fb00017dd89f.jpg" alt="Fuchsia Flowers" width="3264" height="2448" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Perez Vicente / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fuchsia plants are prized for their bright, teardrop-shaped blooms on trailing stems. As shade-loving flowers, fuchsias thrive in spots that get limited light. They definitely should be protected from strong afternoon sun. Plus, a spot that's sheltered from winds is ideal. What fuchsias don't like is hot summer wind blowing on them like a hairdryer. Keep the soil moist but not soggy, and feed your plants once a month with a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choose-right-flower-fertilizer-1315828" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">basic fertilizer</a> for annual flowers.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>10–11 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Red, pink, white, purple, bicolors</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Siberian Bugloss (Brunnera macrophylla)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/l9LncJAdoMxWY_KRTa3HZ7IFMfE=/2121x1414/GettyImages-484261640-5c638ec946e0fb0001ca8e55.jpg" alt="Siberian Bugloss" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">ZoomTravels / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Siberian bugloss is a long-lived and low-maintenance plant, making it one of the best flowers for shade. Its tiny, vivid blue flowers with white centers bloom in the springtime and resemble the flowers of forget-me-nots. Siberian bugloss prefers a shady spot and needs more frequent watering if it’s grown in sunnier conditions. Too much light can burn the foliage and cause the plant to go dormant.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>3–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Blue</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Wax Begonia (Begonia semperflorens)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/s6qDnyhnBT9qJkGJsZR44rSG2Vk=/2879x1922/growing-wax-begonias-5079936-05-c6f81ae5e99b4eb09ff261bf848c21a4-de792004eabc4dbeb566ddbf75b21f17.jpg" alt="wax begonia" width="2879" height="1922" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Adrienne Legault</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wax begonias are a versatile little plant with leaves that appear waxy in either green, bronze, or maroon. These plants do well in containers, as well as in a variety of climates as annuals and perennials. Too much heat and direct sunlight can stress the plants, so they will be appreciative of some shade especially during the warmer months. Also, be sure to keep their soil lightly moist but not soggy, as they can easily succumb to root rot.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>10–11 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Red, pink, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis)</h2><p>Lily of the valley is a hardy ground cover with arching medium green leaves and petite, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. These plants tend to spread quickly and are notoriously shade-loving flowers. They can tolerate direct morning sun but should be protected from strong afternoon sun. Full shade is ideal in warm climates. Water to keep the soil lightly moist but not soggy.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>3–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>White</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Wishbone Flower (Torenia fournieri)</h2><p>Wishbone flowers are annuals that should be planted in the spring after the threat of frost has passed. Their trumpet-shaped blooms will appear in the early summer and stretch until cold weather arrives in the fall. These plants don’t need much sun to bloom at their best. They ideally should get some morning light followed by afternoon shade. But in hot climates they will need a fairly shady spot.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>2–11 (USDA) as an annual</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Blue-purple, lavender, pink, rose, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Loamy, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Lamb's Ear (Stachys byzantina)</h2><p>Lamb’s ear is an interesting, low-growing ground cover plant. Its silvery green leaves are thick and have a fuzzy texture. The plant can thrive in poor soil and has good drought tolerance. Be careful not to overwater it, as it’s susceptible to root rot. Partial shade is best for lamb’s ear, especially in hot and sunny climates. In cool climates it can be grown in full sun. However, the attractive foliage might scorch under strong light.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>4–7 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Light purple</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Well-drained</li></ul><h2>Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea)</h2><p>Foxgloves have a tall, slender growth habit and bloom in the early summer with clusters of tubular flowers. Climate will determine how much light these plants need. In warm climates they require a shady spot to protect them from wilt. In cool climates they can handle full sun, though they still will perform best in partial shade. Make sure not to overwater these plants, as they are susceptible to rot.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>4–10 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties:</strong> Pink, purple, red, white, yellow</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Loamy, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Forget-Me-Not (Myosotis sylvatica)</h2><p>With their delicate, five-petal, bright blue blooms with yellow or white centers, forget-me-nots make a beautiful addition to any garden. These plants have a wide growing range. And if you live in one of the warmer areas where they grow you should give your plants some shade, especially from strong afternoon sun. Forget-me-nots can tolerate more sun in cooler climates. Be sure to deadhead your plants (remove the spent blooms) to cut down on self-seeding if you want to control their spread. </p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>3–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Blue</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Full, partial </li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Liriope (Liriope spicata)</h2><p>Liriope plants are a quite hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover. They have a grassy appearance, spread readily, and send up flower spikes in the late summer to early fall. These plants can handle a range of soil conditions as long as there is good drainage. And they can tolerate various light conditions, including near full shade. They ideally should grow in partial shade, especially in hot climates. Conditions that are too shady can result in slower and more leggy growth.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>4–10 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Lavender, white</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Well-drained</li></ul><h2>Dogtooth Violet (Erythronium albidum)</h2><p>The dogtooth violet produces delicate-looking flowers with curved petals in the springtime. The blooms open with morning light and close in the evening. As one of the best flowers for shade, this plant thrives in woodland settings under the dappled light of trees. It needs protection from harsh sunlight and heat. A layer of mulch around the plant will help to keep the roots cool and retain moisture. </p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>4–9 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>Violet, white, yellow</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Hellebore (Helleborus spp.)</h2><p>The <em>Helleborus</em> genus contains several species of shade-loving flowers. They are among the earliest plants to bloom in the spring with flowers that look similar to roses. These plants thrive in partial to full shade. They can tolerate more sunlight in the spring when the weather is cool and the sun isn’t strong yet. But make sure they will have shade once the temperature rises. Also, be sure not to overwater and allow the plants to sit in soggy soil.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>3–9 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>White, pink, purple, yellow</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul><h2>Primrose (Primula spp.)</h2><p><em>Primula</em> is a large genus of shade-loving flowers. There is considerable variety within the genus. Many of the plants feature dark green leaves and colorful flowers that rise above the foliage on stalks. They’re fairly low-maintenance plants aside from liking consistent watering but not soggy soil. Some species prefer a spot with partial shade but morning sun. However, others do best in a spot that has full shade.</p><ul><li><strong>USDA Growing Zones: </strong>2–8 (USDA)</li><li><strong>Color Varieties: </strong>All colors except green</li><li><strong>Sun Exposure: </strong>Partial, shade</li><li><strong>Soil Needs: </strong>Rich, moist, well-drained</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/l5-7ngGq0QGz91qI6uXuhqNJO8s=/1500x1000/NataliePapierhero-947fc50e2ccd42a183ed5a058fadfc05.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Colorful living room of interior designer Natalie Papier features huge pink ostrich" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Natalie Papier</span></figcaption></figure><p>Who says design rules aren’t meant to be broken every now and then? Personally, I can’t get enough of bust sculptures—which, just a few years ago, never would have fit within my largely blue and white, traditional decor scheme. But as my style has grown and evolved over time, so has my passion for these stone sculptures. And even though my extensive collection is starting to make my home look a little bit museum-like, I just can’t stop scooping up these pieces whenever I come across a new one that I adore. While friends and visitors do often compliment me on how I’ve styled the busts, what’s most important is that they bring <em>me</em> joy every day. </p><p>If there’s a certain off the beaten path print, style, or hue that you love, just go for it—yes, even if you’re a professional. We polled six top interior designers on their biggest guilty pleasures in their homes—their answers may surprise you! </p><h2><strong></strong>Funky Faces</h2><p>Who says the faces displayed in your home have to belong to people you know? “I have quite a thing for quirky vintage portraits,” designer <a href="https://www.nicheinteriors.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Jennifer Jones</a> said in an email. Her passion extends beyond owning just one or two paintings.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/STAI6vKNcaUUPVHMVsDc1ZPGjtY=/4185x6101/JenniferJones-6d6d41403e604c9ab70a540f3fd8f35c.jpg" alt="Living area from designer Jennifer Jones features portraits" width="4185" height="6101" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jennifer Jones</span></figcaption></figure><p>She explained, “One of the walls in my home is dedicated to this ever-growing collection of oil paintings and drawings of women throughout the decades. It’s a fun and unique conversation starter!” Not sure where to purchase oil portraits of your own? Flea markets, vintage stores, and shops such as eBay and Etsy make for excellent places to start! </p><h2><strong></strong>Unexpected Accents </h2><p>Wallpaper has a multitude of potential uses; you’ve just got to get a bit creative. Designer <a href="https://www.daniellerosedesignco.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Danielle Chiprut</a> enjoys “using wallpaper in unconventional places or unconventional ways” around her home. “I most recently wallpapered the ceiling in my home office, and I can't believe how much beauty the bold floral print added to the space,” she noted in an email.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/JxCTyUR3jE9bwzwaUbLE3N_81FI=/3024x4032/DanielleChiprut-e0af2380ec574fdb882cd0ca59aab5d8.JPG" alt="Danielle Chiprut's wallpapered ceiling in her home office" width="3024" height="4032" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Danielle Chiprut</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Not only did the look of the room change, but I also feel inspired and energized every time I look up!” Wallpaper is an excellent vehicle through which one can take calculated decor risks. Added Chiprut, “I love the idea of adding an unexpected twist to a tried and true design staple.” </p><h2><strong></strong>Quirky Creatures </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/b9uZ_AdMqpUGoP6KC42vQOn8kkA=/3024x4032/NataliePapier1-c80f7dab2f2f459ea77c953ae5d17c75.jpeg" alt="Natalie Papier's living room features lots of animal themes, including the huge pink ostrich" width="3024" height="4032" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Natalie Papier</span></figcaption></figure><p>Designer <a href="https://www.homeecop.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Natalie Papier</a> can’t get enough of featuring animal-themed pieces in her spaces. “Monkey wallpaper, horse statues, giant wooden cobra, tiger rug, swan table...the quirkier, the better,” she stated in an email.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/5KcG7b5qoAfdn4LhmI1QzsDGGuY=/3011x4014/NataliePapier2-da1aa9c4b9584fc791f0b8c8cadb0f5a.jpeg" alt="Natalie Papier's living room features a console table with black swans as the base" width="3011" height="4014" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Natalie Papier</span></figcaption></figure><p>“It’s like my own Noah’s Ark up in here.” In addition to being charming, these touches help prevent a home from feeling too severe or serious. Added Papier, “There is a whimsy and playfulness to adding animal decor into your home I can’t get enough of!” </p><h2><strong></strong>A Makeshift Garden </h2><p>Green friends are nothing new; in fact, we can’t get enough of them! But decorating with all faux plants like <a href="https://simplychinteriors.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Caroline Harvey</a> does is something we don’t see quite as often. “It’s not that I have a black thumb, but I prefer only having to tend to live plants outdoors,” Harvey explained in an email. “Plus, the quality and authenticity of fake plants has improved significantly in the last few years—some are quite beautiful and hard to detect!” </p><p>No matter your unexpected design staple of choice, there’s no reason to be shy about displaying decorative objects that you love. Oftentimes, the more risks you take in your home, the more potential for reward—and if nothing else, you’re bound to have some excellent conversation starters when guests pay a visit! </p><h2>Military Memorabilia </h2><p>Designer <a href="https://alluringdesignschicago.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">April Gandy</a>, who along with her late grandfather is also an Air Force veteran, greatly appreciates featuring a special piece of their shared history in her home. “My house is totally transitional Hollywood glam, but my one guilty pleasure that is so not my style is my grandfather’s flag shadow box,” she said in an email. It doesn’t bother Gandy that the flag “never matches anything,” as the item carries so much sentimental value. Plus, she noted, “It’s also a great conversation piece!” </p><h2>Natural Touches</h2><p>Who doesn’t love displaying a fresh bouquet of flowers when the opportunity strikes? “Fresh flowers always finish off a space and enhance my mood,” designer <a href="http://www.amyyoungblood.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Amy Youngblood</a> said in an email. However, Youngblood enjoys taking her arranging a bit further by incorporating unexpected elements from nature; she particularly enjoys mixing in rocks and twigs. “It really brings the outdoors inside,” she added. “For me, the mix of natural elements with elegant flowers makes an eclectic, thoughtful piece of decor that is much more interesting than a bunch of roses, say bought at the grocery store.” Not sure where to find such accents? You may not need to look too far. As Youngblood noted, “You can even go in your own backyard to make these types of arrangements as well!” </p>]]></content:encoded>

This deluxe set provides just about everything you need for a well-stocked power tool collection. You’ll get one each of the following: 20V MAX XR oscillating multi-tool, 20V MAX ½-Inch compact drill driver, 20V MAX ¼-Inch impact driver, 20V MAX compact jobsite blower, 20V MAX circular saw, 20V MAX reciprocating saw, 20V MAX 4-1/2-inch grinder, LED work light, wet/dry vacuum, and a jobsite Bluetooth speaker. That’s a whole lot of tools ready and able to tackle just about any DIY project you throw at them.</p><p>The set also includes two 20-volt lithium-ion batteries, a charger, and a handy contractor’s bag to keep everything portable and together.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Home Tool Kit</h2><h3>Experience Level</h3><p>Some tool kits are better suited for more experienced users. If you’re a beginner, you’re probably better off with a basic kit of the must-have tools, including a hammer, set of screwdrivers, pliers, level, tape measure, and an adjustable wrench. However, if you have more experience working around the house, you might be looking for more advanced tools to supplement your existing arsenal, such as specialized screwdrivers, a small handsaw, putty and utility knives, laser level, and a socket set.</p><h3>Intended Projects</h3><p>Is there a particular task you need to complete with your tool kit? For example, if you’re hanging a painting, you’ll probably need a measuring tape, level, screwdriver or hammer, and maybe even a stud finder. Think about what you’ll be using your tools for as you hunt for the perfect home kit.</p><h3>Storage Space</h3><p>Even though it's not the most important factor to consider when buying a tool kit, you should think about how much space it will take up in your home. If you’re living in a small apartment, a complex product with several hundred pieces will take up a solid chunk of your storage space. On the other hand, if you have a whole garage to dedicate to your tools, you have plenty of room to store a comprehensive kit.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>As a lifelong DIY enthusiast who’s built several pieces of furniture, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/camryn-rabideau-4174123" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Camryn Rabideau</a> is no stranger to the importance of high-quality tools.

<title>The 8 Pergola Kits That Offer Plenty of Shade</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/LIbLdrJzSAysUMR1T2daliR3DOs=/3867x2578/GettyImages-512633809-56fd902b3df78c7d9e0850b9.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[The perfect pergola kit should be easy to assemble, durable, and attractive. We researched the top options so you can find the right one for your space.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-a-pergola-2131097" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Pergolas</a> are outdoor structures that provide shade and add style to your lawn or garden. If you love to spend time outside, adding a pergola can make your space comfortable even during the hot, sunny days of Summer or the cool, windy nights of Spring and Autumn. For plant lovers, pergolas offer the perfect place for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-vines-grow-on-pergolas-arbors-4066951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">climbing plants</a> to enjoy. They can even create a focal point for your yard.</p><p>Many pergola kits come delivered right to your door. With just a little bit of assembly, you can create a pergola that is both stylish and practical. A kit allows you to make your pergola without any specialized tools or knowledge. For many homeowners, this convenience can provide the confidence needed to tackle this <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/awesome-backyard-diys-4126830" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">yard upgrade project</a>.</p><p>Here, the best pergola kits to elevate your outdoor space.</p><p>This pergola combines the easy maintenance of vinyl with the traditional look of most wood pergolas, all at a budget-friendly price. The overhead lattice is ideal for climbing plants and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/the-best-annual-flowering-vines-and-climbers-1401930" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">flowering vines</a>, or for the addition of a canopy. Assembly is straightforward, although you will need some additional tools and help to get it finished.</p><p>At 10 feet x 10 feet, this pergola kit is just the right size for most uses, although those planning to host large gatherings may want something bigger. You can sit comfortably for dinner at an outdoor table underneath or set up a cozy conversation area around a firepit or other focal point.</p><p>This pergola kit is just as easy on the eyes as it is on the wallet. Made of rust-resistant, powder-coated metal, the Sunjoy Metal Pergola kit is great for year-round use no matter the weather. It offers 104.5 square feet of coverage, with plenty of space for a table and chairs, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-buying-a-fire-pit-2736908" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">firepit</a>, or space to lounge. Although pergola kits are a sizable investment for any backyard, this pick is more affordable than most.</p><p>The shape is slightly arched, which provides an additional architectural detail that many homeowners look for when upgrading their outdoor space. You can use the included canopy to provide shade or assemble it without, especially if you plan to use your pergola to grow <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-vines-grow-on-pergolas-arbors-4066951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">climbing plants</a>.</p><p>If you're looking to get the best of the best for your outdoor area, Backyard Discovery has a lot of great options that look attractive, are built to last, and have special features. One of their more expensive models, the Laguna Cabana with Conversation Seating, doesn’t cover a lot of space but has everything you need for a relaxing stay right in your own backyard.</p><p>For a small pergola, this triangular option from Backyard Discovery is pricey, but the extra features make it worth the splurge. It includes seating for six adults, slat details on the top, decorative panels on the sides, removable Sunbrella cushions, and a square table. It's the perfect piece of furniture for creating a cozy nook in your backyard or outdoor space.</p><p>If you're in the market for something that's constructed of wood, this pergola kit is made of 100 percent Western Red <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/keep-cedar-wood-protected-4125926" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Cedar</a>, which is naturally mold, rot, and mildew resistant. Every piece comes pre-cut, pre-stained, and with pre-drilled holes. All you need to do is assemble and enjoy. It’s best to have some help with assembly, though, as many of the pieces require two people to lift.</p><p>Although this pergola has a smaller coverage area than other options on this list, it's the perfect size for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/small-backyard-landscaping-ideas-4691367" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">smaller outdoor spaces</a>. Place a grill underneath the pergola or two Adirondack chairs for a picturesque retreat. It will extend your home's outdoor living space and still provide some shelter from the rain and sun.</p><p>For a pergola kit that requires almost no maintenance, a vinyl option looks great and is easy to take care of with just a hose and water. In addition to being constructed from vinyl with a 20-year warranty, the Vita Camelot Pergola has a louvered canopy. By just pushing the louvers closed, you can get more shade or protection from rain and wind. This pergola truly becomes an outdoor room that is easy to enjoy and maintain.</p><p>If you're interested in further customizing this kit, Vita offers a nice assortment of accessories and add-ons. For a pop of color and greenery, opt for a lattice panel trellis, which creates an additional privacy screen for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vegetables-to-trellis-1403432" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">plants to grow</a> as well as provides some additional protection from the wind. The add-ons can be a great way to add some extra sparkle to an otherwise simple pergola design.</p><p>Sometimes pergola users want the option of a retractable canopy that can offer shade on a sunny day. The Longford Wood Outdoor Pergola has an easy-to-use retractable canopy that can be extended or retracted within minutes. Assembly is relatively straightforward and there's plenty of space underneath for a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/outdoor-dining-spaces-the-best-design-tips-and-tricks-4121195" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">table and chairs</a>, a grouping of lounge chairs, or a conversation area with a firepit or low table. It is the perfect addition for yards that experience both sun and shade throughout the day or year.</p><p>If you want to provide shade and comfort to a large space, this pergola kit is a whopping 12 feet x 24 feet. It has multiple supports to make sure that it can withstand weather and wind, as well as a detailed lattice design overhead. It only comes in white, which offers a clean and modern look to your yard.</p><p>As expected with such a large piece, the assembly process is lengthy. It arrives in 11 boxes and requires multiple people to move and assemble. You will need some tools to finish the assembly, such as a power drill, and cement if you want to install it in-ground. Once you assemble the pergola, it weighs over 400 pounds, so it’s best to get it set up exactly where you plan to use it.</p><p>Most pergola kits require multiple people and additional tools to assemble. If you're looking to get the benefit of shade without the work of assembly, a sun shade may be the perfect solution. This pergola alternative looks modern and works great to provide shade, although it’s not well suited to offer much protection from wind or heavy rain. Many sail shades are packable and can be set up by just one person.</p><p>This extra-large sun shade from AsterOutdoor measures 16 feet x 20 feet, comes in four neutral colors, and costs less than the other picks on this list. The fabric itself offers some protection from UV rays, making it a great choice for areas that see a lot of sun. It does require four attachment points on the exterior of your home, a shed, or from freestanding support. The included attachment tethers are each 5 feet long, which provides some versatility when looking for the ideal place to set it up.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Pergola Kit</h2><h3>Size</h3><p>The first factor that you need to consider when selecting a pergola kit is the size of your space. Pergolas are generally rectangular, square, or triangular and come in a variety of sizes. If you opt for a rectangular pergola, they often look best with the long side parallel with your home, although setting up your pergola is all about personal preference.</p><p>If you want to use your pergola for a dining area, make sure that you choose a size that allows your table and chairs to sit comfortably underneath. It helps to set up your space and then mark out the ideal pergola size with paint, chalk, or string. Allow extra space for people to push chairs out from the table, making sure that they can do so without bumping into the pergola frame.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you are planning to use your pergola over a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-install-pavers-2132503" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">paver patio</a>, most companies recommend that you buy a pergola that is larger than your space. This allows you to anchor the pergola structure into the ground, which is very important to help it withstand wind or rain.</p><h3><strong><br></strong>Material</h3><p>Pergolas come in vinyl, wood, or metal. Vinyl is one of the most popular options due to its low maintenance, but it can be more expensive or have fewer craftsman-like details. Wood pergolas are often constructed from cedar, which has an attractive look and is mold and mildew resistant. If you choose a metal pergola, make sure that it is powder-coated to increase its longevity. Powder-coated metal prevents rust, which can quickly make your pergola unsafe as well as unattractive.</p><h3>Ease of installation</h3><p>Due to their size and the requirement for heavy overhead pieces, pergola kits almost always require two or more people to assemble. Having a ladder or two nearby can make the process easier, as people don’t have to hold heavy beams overhead as much.</p><p>The easiest to install pergola kits have pre-drilled holes and pre-cut pieces. Assembly instructions with diagrams, online tutorials, and company support can also make installation much easier. For the trickiest setups, it may be worth hiring a professional to do the literal heavy lifting for you.</p><h3>Extra features</h3><p>If you are considering a pergola to spruce up your yard, chances are you value outdoor entertaining and comfort. A pergola kit that has built-in seating or a table creates not just a comfortable place in the shade but an all-inclusive retreat for you or your guests to enjoy.

<title>The 10 Best Cornhole Boards of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ogSj-kijl8eqZ-lnCDSqo2s7kh0=/2765x1843/cornhole-game-board-513042824-e6d84b8e6bf641668e436e3476c41ac8.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[The perfect cornhole board is durable and easy to set up. We researched the best cornhole boards to help you find the right one for your yard.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to lawn games, nothing is quite as prevalent as cornhole. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/diy-yard-games-4126782" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">family-friendly</a> game is easy to play and holds the attention of crowds for hours at a time. But it’s not easy to find a great set—they tend to be heavy and expensive or flimsy and cheap. Finding that Goldilocks set that’s sturdy, attractive, and within a reasonable price range is possible, and we've found a few options.</p><p>Here, the best cornhole boards to buy for your backyard or tailgate.</p><p>The GoSports Solid Wood Premium Cornhole Set is a sturdy, regulation size set that makes it suitable for both recreational or tournament-style play, and takes the spot as our best overall pick. The 4 x 2-foot boards are made from premium varnished pine wood that are 100 percent ready for use. (Though they can also be easily painted or customized for a fun project.) To complete the set, you’ll also get eight regulation bean bags, a bean bag tote, a rule book, and a carrying case for the boards. </p><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/cornhole-board-plans-5071188" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Cornhole</a> is a great game for cookouts and tailgates, so you’ll appreciate that this set is easy to put in the back of your car if you want to take it on the go with you. Simply fold up the legs and slip it into the handled carrying case to take it with you—it only takes a minute or two to set up when you get to your destination. Just be aware that it's not lightweight, so it's not ideal for beach trips or park days where you might need to do some walking.</p><p>Because most cornhole sets are made of solid wood, they tend to be rather pricey. But if you’re looking for a budget-friendly set that doesn’t sacrifice on quality, this is it. The set includes two wooden game platforms that have scratch-resistant melamine laminate surfaces.</p><p>Sturdy foldable wooden legs mean the game is nice and stable during play, but easy to stash or transport to wherever the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-throw-an-outdoor-party-4586521" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">party</a> is. Just keep in mind: These cornhole boards are a bit smaller than regulation size, so they aren’t ideal for true tournament play. That won’t stop you from having a ton of backyard fun, though—and the smaller target will make for a longer game.</p><p>When it comes to design, you can’t beat these boards by GoSport. The boards are tournament sized and come with eight bean bags, so you can use them recreationally or in true competition. They have a fold-up design complete with carrying handles that make it easy for one person to set them up or move them around. </p><p>Perhaps the best design feature, though, is built-in LED light rings that allow you to play your games day or night. When the sun starts to set, simply flip a switch to light up the hole in the board. Each ring is powered for more than 24 hours by three included AA batteries.</p><p>This regulation-size cornhole set is a great example of what a quality game looks like. The walnut wooden boards feature an incredibly stylish two-tone design, marrying aesthetic and function. Both boards are extremely sturdy on their feet, but the legs fold flat under the frame when not in use. There’s also a pouch underneath one of the boards to contain the bean bags to ensure everything you need to play is all in one place. What’s more, the two boards nest together to form a carrying case with an oversized and comfortable rope handle, so you can tote everything out to your backyard more easily.</p><p>Personalized cornhole boards are great options for events like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/throwing-an-engagement-party-3489711" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">engagement parties</a>, weddings, or anniversaries. They also make a great gift idea!</p><p>We love that this particular set is fully custom—both the boards and the bags. The wooden boards, which come in your choice of four finishes (dark walnut, natural, red oak, or early American), can be personalized with a name or monogram in one of nearly 20 different fonts. The bags—available in two dozen colors—come embroidered with a matching name or monogram to complete the set. </p><p>The quality is there, too. Each board is made with high-quality wood. The bags are just as well made—each of the eight regulation size bags are filled with resin to keep them game-ready for a long time.</p><p>This family favorite is a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/backyard-bbq-essentials-4053255" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">barbecue staple</a> for a reason, and because it’s so well loved, it’s a game you’ll find yourself playing in a variety of places, whether camping, tailgating, or spending the day at the beach. But most cornhole sets are made out of wood—while they're portable, you might be on the lookout for something more lightweight.</p><p>This set—which includes two cornhole boards, eight bean bags, and a convenient carrying case—is really meant to be played on the go. It's made of PVC and polyester fabric, which makes it easy to pack up for a tailgate, beach day, or trip to a friend's home. At just 10 pounds, the lightweight set folds up easily and fits nicely in a compact travel case that you’ll have no problem fitting into your car or carrying for a brief walk to your destination.</p><p>If there’s any place cornhole is extremely prevalent, it’s a tailgate. Why not up the ante by investing in a set emblazoned with your team’s name? Though not quite regulation size, this set comes with two perfectly suitable 2 x 3-foot boards in a brown wood finish with your choice of team logo. </p><p>The boards are portable enough for the tailgate, too. They have foldable legs and a carrying handle, so one person can transport and set up the game.</p><p>If you have a tendency to leave your cornhole set outdoors, you frequently bring your set to the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/host-a-beach-party-1197486" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">beach</a> or the lake, or your area is prone to wet weather, you’ll love these waterproof cornhole boards. The durable plastic boards are safe for any condition—they hold up well in all kinds of high-moisture and high-humidity conditions so you don't have to pack them inside if the forecast is gloomy. The bean bags are weather-proof, too, since they’re filled with moisture-proof plastic pellets and then double-stitched closed. </p><p>The set is extremely portable; the boards snap together for storage and have built-in bean bag storage underneath. Unlike some lightweight plastic sets, this one can be made sturdier by filling the boards with water to weigh them down and keep them in place.</p><p>For maximum versatility, try this multi-game set. While you’ll have to sacrifice on quality a bit—everything is plastic rather than high-quality wood—what you get is the ability to move from game to game with ease. The combination game set is made of two fold-in-half tables that can be used to play cornhole or ladder golf. Alternatively, they can be used as a table for tailgating or games like beer pong or flip cup. </p><p>The set is virtually indestructible, thanks to UV-protected high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that won’t fade, crack, or split due to sun damage. If you do a lot of outdoor cookouts with friends and family, this set is great to have on-hand in your garage or basement.</p><p>For the kids, consider a cornhole set that’s on the smaller side and comes in super fun and vibrant colors. The scaled-down boards measure 16 x 24 inches and are approximately 3 inches thick to make it easier for kids to play along. The eight bags are also a bit smaller, measuring 3.5 x 3.5 inches—just right for a child's hand.</p><p>Pick your child’s favorite color from one of six color schemes, or for a little bit of extra fun, buy the set unpainted and have fun creating your own design together once the set is in hand.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/brigitt-earley-4174127" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Brigitt Earley</a>, a freelance writer who has spent the last 10-plus years researching the best home goods for various digital publications, including The Spruce and Good Housekeeping.

<title>Meet a NYC Drag Queen Who Has Over 200 Plants</title>

<description><![CDATA[Look inside the Brooklyn apartment of NYC drag queen MissLeidy The Plant lady, who has more than 200 plants.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/w1d7LfFxUkSLRySUpTUff3dsmCo=/1500x1000/SPR-ITW-PrimaryImage_JimiUrquiaga3-334d8c9ea15947a18f1b54edeee52ef1.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="MissLeidy the Plant Lady poses for In the Weeds With Plant People" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Meghal Jordan</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking for a house tour filled with a lot of personality, look no further. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missleidytheplantlady/?hl=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">MissLeidy The Plant Lady</a> kicks off her tour by letting us know “I don’t want nothing basic in my house.” And her plants are anything but basic. Room after room is filled with unique plant after plant and taking a peek into this Brooklyn apartment filled to the brim (in a good way) with 200 plants. </p><h2>In This Episode</h2><p>The first plant we get a close look at is the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/snake-plant-care-overview-1902772" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sansevieria</a> Bantel’s Sensation which has stunning foliage—some patterned and some stripey. Next up MissLeidy tells us that the plant she looks like the most is the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-peacock-plants-5089220" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">Calathea Makoyana</a> (and it’s one of the healthiest looking calathea we’ve seen). She's lays out all the ways they are similar: “Because one, she’s gorgeous. Two, she’s perfect. Three, she’s impeccable. Should I keep going, or do you get the gist?” </p><p>Her sense of humor nearly steals the show from her plants, especially when she tells us, “Get rid of your kids. Get rid of your wife. Get rid of your granny. Because I’m bringing in some palms, baby.” Basically she just loves plants and doesn’t care how much space they take up.</p><h3>How She Started Collecting Plants</h3><p>When she first moved to New York MissLeidy lived in a warehouse apartment with no windows (every plant lover's nightmare), then she decided to move to a tiny apartment that had a little window. From there she added one plant and then 10 days and 40 more plants later, her love for greenery was confirmed. Her biggest inspiration when it comes to plants were her grandparents. “They came from Cuba and the way they decorated their house growing up was very lush, green, tropical vibes. Very reminiscent of La Habana Vieja.”</p><h3>Her Gorgeous Plant Collection</h3><p>Moving through her apartment we come to her weirdest plant, the Rhipsalis pilocarpa, a rare cactus that likes moisture and humidity, she says. Then we come to her most treasured plant, a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-philodendron-houseplants-1902768" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Philodendron</a> Plowmanii. The leaves are gorgeous and MissLeidy even calls the plant a diva. We get to take a glimpse at her first plant which was a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/grow-monstera-adansonii-swiss-cheese-plant-1902774" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">Monstera Adansonii </a>and has gorgeous leaves with stunning holes in them. </p><p>Then we head to her bedroom which is filled with an amazing propagation station. She’s also got her favorite and most prized plants in there. Her rarest plant is the Philodendron El Choco Red. “The reason they call it el choco is because it has these brown chocolate backsides, or a little reddish. When I found this, I was freakin hot!” We also get to see her Thaumatophyllum Spruceanum which looks like it would be found in a fantasy world. </p><h3>Why Plants Are So Important to Her</h3><p>MissLeidy leaves us with some great words about the value of plants: “It comes down to mental health. Some days I wake up and I’m in a funk. I don’t want to get out of bed. I’m feeling down. But, I brought these green babies into my space so I have the responsibility to take care of them. And in hindsight they help me, while I help them.” So, what are you waiting for? Check out this epic plant tour now. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>7 Expert-Approved Styling and Design Tips From Photographers</title>

<description><![CDATA[Two interior design photographers share their expert tips for styling and designing a room for maximum visual impact and appeal.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ws5oza4u4pOpj44nhflb-mnxW6k=/1670x1193/PhotobySaraLiggoria-TrampofherhomedesignedbyVelindaHellen-4f802c2ced3b405abbb0fd0d3ea90cc2.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="A staged living room featuring plants" width="1670" height="1193" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sara Liggoria-Tramp</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to asking interior design teams for their insider tips, there’s one member who’s often overlooked: the photographer. But if anyone can visually assess a space, it’s the pro behind the camera! So we spoke with two top interior photographers to ask for their insight on how to style a space for maximum visual impact.</p><h2>Create Visual 'Landing Points'</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/GtivaDPs_JqOzk1x47Yyao0IXP0=/3600x2403/191202-472Livingroom-032a1821692242a1b318d606f5994a2d.jpg" alt="Living room with lots of sunlight, well curated bookshelves, and a fire in the fireplace" width="3600" height="2403" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Miriam Sheridan</span></figcaption></figure><p>Photographer <a href="https://www.msheridanphotography.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Miriam Sheridan</a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/miriamsheridanphotography/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">@miriamsheridanphotography</a>) told us that when composing a shot, “I want the viewers’ eye to have landing points around the room. You want the eye to travel—to bounce a little bit, not stay too long anywhere, or be blocked by anything.”</p><p>This means that one of Miriam’s biggest priorities is to avoid blank spaces. “If there’s nothing in the middle of the room, the eye has to travel too far. It either lands on a big, vacant space in the middle or drifts to the other side. It unbalances the image.”</p><p>This is why coffee tables aren’t just a key functional item—they also help create a visual landing point. But it’s not enough to just have a coffee table, either. “There needs to be something there, and you need something <em>on</em> the coffee table. It can’t be something too large, because that will have too much gravitas. But you need something on there so the room is balanced and your eye can travel.”</p><p>When decorating your coffee table, think of small items, like trays holding candles or small vases of flowers, or stacks of books.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/kWNtJ7AUsCiQPBj3O-c2bL4TKxI=/3600x2402/210417-637Livingroomunstaged-8a8b76419e604df09e3616e7ae10d28b.jpg" alt="A living room without a coffee table and unstaged" width="3600" height="2402" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Miriam Sheridan</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Keep Eyes Off the TV</h2><p>Miriam pointed out that it’s not just the areas that are devoid of furniture that can throw off the balance of a room. An area that’s overwhelmed by one specific item can also create an unpleasant aesthetic. </p><p>“[The TV is] a big, solid, black square that sucks a lot of balance out of a room,” Miriam said. “If you’re walking into a room and the TV is directly opposite, it’s going to be the first thing your eye travels to. It’s not pleasing! It’s sort of a black hole of energy.” While Miriam can work her angles to avoid shooting a room with the television in the center, you can use other tricks for real life. </p><p>“Do things to break up the shape. Add flowers next to and slightly in front of the TV to break up the shape. Painting the wall behind the TV a dark color also works well, as it softens the look."</p><p>“I love it when people have them on swivel brackets so you can kind of slide it back!”</p><h2>Never Underestimate the Power of Pillows and Throws</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/VPmkdq2_igG12NV7dKGby7gR_HY=/7000x4672/210208-734VS-2006b95cc88543969fc2f72cf9ca5032.jpg" alt="A staged bed with throw pillows and a blanket to enhance the look" width="7000" height="4672" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Miriam Sheridan</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with the TV and coffee table, beds and sofas can also create blank spaces that displease the eye. “People don’t understand how much a difference cushions and a throw can make. Without it, you end up with a big expanse. You need to break up the main surface of the bed [or the sofa].”</p><p>“At the head of the bed, you need something pleasing at the top. Two plain pillows is not very aesthetically zen,” laughed Miriam. “A bunch of cushions makes a big difference! It changes how the whole bed area looks. People pull the duvet up over the pillows, but it extends this expansive nothingness.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/_cXY8svjdChP4gaQzNleVEQVckQ=/2360x1575/210208-734-24d2fe20eadc4ef68f996a301526985a.jpg" alt="an unstaged bed" width="2360" height="1575" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Miriam Sheridan</span></figcaption></figure><h2>The Best Accessories Are Alive</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ws5oza4u4pOpj44nhflb-mnxW6k=/1670x1193/PhotobySaraLiggoria-TrampofherhomedesignedbyVelindaHellen-4f802c2ced3b405abbb0fd0d3ea90cc2.jpg" alt="A staged living room featuring plants" width="1670" height="1193" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sara Liggoria-Tramp</span></figcaption></figure><p>Photographer <a href="https://www.hellosaratramp.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Sara Liggoria-Tramp</a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hellosaratrampinteriors/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">@hellosaratrampinteriors</a>) spoke to us about the power of accessorizing. “Bring in the greens!” she said. “Plants are the second-best styling accessory in any interior stylist or photographers’ tool kit. Branches are naturally sculptural, hanging plants drape with an organic grace few throws can mimic, and the sense of life they bring into a photo is immediate. Keeping flowers and plants in your home will only make it feel better.”</p><p>If you’re not a plant person, then Sara has another suggestion for warming up a room. “What takes the number one spot for styling accessories? A sweet dog or snoozing cat, hands down.”</p><h2>Don't Block the Eye</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/2Lg9nStDrgKGJcb4eJQNd6llyMs=/1779x2224/PhotobySaraLiggoria-TramphomeofJaclynJohnsonstyledbyCJdesignedbyGinnyMacdonald-caf5674e8ddc4f3f897d3ff3805993bb.jpg" alt="Home of Jaclyn Johnson, styled by CJ, designed by Ginny Macdonald" width="1779" height="2224" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sara Liggoria-Tramp</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sara’s top tip for entering a room is to avoid greeting your guests with the back of a sofa. “There are a few cases where it can work, and sometimes a home doesn't allow for any other layout, but generally walking into a space that isn't immediately cut in half by a piece of furniture is going to make your home feel a lot bigger.”</p><p>This is something Sara’s even incorporated into her own home. “In my living room, we have our sofa pushed up against the front door wall,” she said. “[That way], when you walk in, you get to see the whole layout of the space, rather than having the sofa right in the entryway, facing the fireplace.”</p><h2>Let the Light In</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/xNgtD9-Zu-DINBfMZvBGGLXfAFw=/1625x2031/PhotobySaraLiggoria-TrampdesignedbyJubileeInteriors-fac2b235910e46e6857f8f9ebda786cd.jpg" alt="Living area designed by Jubilee Interiors with a leather ottoman and table in front of a huge mirror and window" width="1625" height="2031" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sara Liggoria-Tramp</span></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a reason we all love large, expansive windows. Light is the main thing to set the tone for a room. “Allow in as much light as you can,” said Sara. “During the day, that means natural light. 99% of the time I shoot using only natural light, and it helps space feel natural and happy.”</p><p>This doesn’t just apply to her work life, either. “When I'm home, I live kind of the same way,” said Sara. “[I] open up all my window treatments to let in as much natural light as possible. As we've been renovating our home we've tried to find as many opportunities for more natural light as possible, including a skylight in the primary bathroom and a sun tunnel in our primary closet. In the evening lots of cozy lamps, rather than bright overhead lights, makes a space feel cozy and homey."</p><h2>Texture Is Everything</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/LFJxOwOsAcHq4AG-ItPWM7HTqY8=/2136x2689/PhotobySaraLiggoria-TrampstyledbyEmilyEdithBowserkitchendesignedbySarahEZachary-20c5a569fbd84149b91e48239e1a4a5f.jpg" alt="Kitchen styled by Emily Edith Bowser, designed by Sarah E Zachary" width="2136" height="2689" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sara Liggoria-Tramp</span></figcaption></figure><p>“I work with a lot of talented stylists when shooting, and we almost always like to include some sort of organic texture in the shot,” said Sara. “That could be a throw on a sofa, a hand towel over a sink ledge, or some branches on a dining table. It helps the space feel lived in, inviting, and warm––even if the design aesthetic is minimal.” </p><p>“Hot tip: I think styling bedding is the absolute HARDEST thing in interiors. There are people who specialize in it! In my own home, I opt for bedding that looks better [when] wrinkled and textured, like hemp or linen.”</p><p>Next time you’re looking to style a room, step back and consider things from a photographer’s perspective.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description><![CDATA[Flowering shrubs, and trees offer great spring color. Here are 10 types to choose from, including dogwoods, flowering quince, magnolia, and forsythia.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ONo5ePK782weyosZgw4CZFsHkMY=/4288x2848/flowering-dogwood-trees-2131196-Hero-7d4a7d832e6247a48f9a917029d4b113.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Eastern redbud tree with long thin branches and small pink flowers in the shade" width="4288" height="2848" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><p>The end of the long gray winter months is often announced not by spring bulbs but by flowering trees and shrubs such as dogwoods. The merit of these trees can extend well past spring, however, because the flowers on many varieties give way to berries that attract wild birds, and some offer colorful foliage in autumn. There are even multitaskers that boast more than just ornamental qualities by bearing edible fruit.</p><h2>Criteria for a Great Spring Tree or Shrub</h2><p>Several virtues will make a particular spring-blooming tree or shrub a good choice for your landscape: </p><ul><li>Showiness of bloom</li><li>Foliage interest, including multi-season color</li><li>Interesting branching patterns</li><li>Cold hardiness</li><li>Berry output and beauty</li><li>Ease of maintenance, including disease-resistance</li></ul><p>Some very popular spring-flowering shrubs (<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-care-for-azaleas-5074145#:~:text=How%20to%20Grow%20Azaleas.%20Proper%20planting%20is%20key,water%20daily%20for%20the%20first%20week%20until%20established." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">azaleas</a> and rhododendrons, for example) don't make the list because they are not particularly attractive after the spectacular spring bloom season is completed.</p><p>The trees and shrubs selected below are divided equally between early bloomers and late bloomers. Early bloomers are those that flower by early April, while late bloomers are those that bloom only after spring has fully sprung (late April or perhaps early May). A well-designed landscape features mixed planting of flowering trees and shrubs and includes both early bloomers and later bloomers.</p><p>All of the plants on the list should be grown in full sun, although flowering dogwood often does just as well in part shade. While most of the plants on this list are regarded as <em>low-</em>maintenance, this should not be confused with<em> no</em> maintenance. It's always a good idea to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/winterizing-flowering-bushes-2132701" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">winterize flowering shrubs</a>, especially when they are young, to protect them against the harshness of winter. </p><p> </p><h2>Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida, Cornus kousa)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/QrZuKE2geL_oA7VmjwxFnZil8mw=/4288x2848/flowering-dogwood-trees-2131196-01-eb6a718ca7c34f338c66852bbb3efa55.jpg" alt="Flowering dogwood branches with pink flowers against clear blue sky" width="4288" height="2848" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><p>All things considered,<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/dogwoods-offer-winter-spring-and-fall-color-2132856" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"> dogwoods</a> win the top ranking for spring bloomers, with an impressive number of landscaping benefits. The branching pattern of flowering dogwood trees is rather horizontal, which gives visual interest at any time of year. The two main standouts in this group are the flowering dogwood tree (<em>Cornus florida</em>), an American native species, and the Japanese dogwood tree (<em>Cornus kousa</em>).</p><p>Two popular varieties of <em>Cornus florida </em>are 'Cherokee Chief' and 'Rubra'. 'Cherokee Chief' attains a maximum height of about 25 feet with a spread of about 15 feet. Its springtime flowers are red and yield berries that birds like to eat. In autumn the leaves turn bronzy-red. 'Rubra' is commonly known as <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pink-dogwood-trees-2132136" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">pink dogwood</a> or pink flowering dogwood.

The pink buds open in April to become single white blooms. The flowers are fragrant, although they do not smell as good as another springtime favorite, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lilac-bushes-growing-tips-2132722" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">lilac bushes</a>. The tree has good fall color, and the ornamental fruits last through the winter; wild birds eat them into February and March.</p><p>Avoid spring pruning with this tree, as the open wounds can be susceptible to fireblight infection. Instead, prune in late winter.</p><p><strong>USDA Growing Zones</strong>: 4–8</p><p><strong>Color Varieties</strong>: Pink, transitioning to white</p><p><strong>Sun Exposure:</strong> Full sun</p><p><strong>Soil Needs</strong>: Well-drained, acidic loam</p><h2>Flowering Quince (Chaenomeles speciosa)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/lygbUvBKQhwn6-Mg2AHTxVFnVDI=/2121x1414/GettyImages-1130074500-3f13c3ee95884f5a97aa0948dd56000c.jpg" alt="flowering Japanese quince flowers" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jacky Parker Photography / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>A particularly good form of quince is the 'Cameo' (<em>Chaenomeles speciosa</em> 'Cameo'), a compact, spreading, flowering bush that is well-suited for a low border or hedge (this is a thorny plant). It grows to a mature height of 2 to 4 feet, with a spread of 3 to 5 feet. Its double peach spring blooms, arriving in March and April, easily make this a favorite shrub. The edible reddish-yellow quince berries ripen in fall and are commonly used for preserves and jellies.</p><p>Root suckers should be regularly pruned away to prevent flowering quince shrubs from spreading.</p><p><strong>USDA Growing Zones</strong>: 4–8</p><p><strong>Color Varieties</strong>: Pale red to scarlet</p><p><strong>Sun Exposure:</strong> Full sun to part shade</p><p><strong>Soil Needs</strong>: Medium moisture, well-drained soil</p><h2>Saucer Magnolia (Magnolia x soulangiana)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/hCdtbTmCVXnlgPBPPrAUYGAuX-M=/375x500/japmag6-56a318f25f9b58b7d0d051ad.jpg" alt="Saucer Magnolia | Japanese Magnolia | Tulip Tree" width="375" height="500" /><figcaption>Saucer Magnolia | Japanese Magnolia | Tulip Tree</figcaption></figure><p>Although <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/star-magnolia-trees-2132137" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">star magnolia </a>(<em>Magnolia stellata</em>) blooms before <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/magnolia-trees-saucer-magnolias-2132135" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">saucer magnolia </a>(<em>Magnolia x soulangiana</em>), saucer's large, cup-shaped flowers appearing in March make this a prized tree. Flowers are rose to purple outside, with a soft, white interior. This tree reaches 20 to 30 feet in height with a similar spread. Star magnolia is a bit smaller (15 to 20 tall, with a spread slightly less than that).</p><p>Late spring frosts can damage the flowers, but the plant generally recovers.

To many gardeners, spring just wouldn't be spring without the vibrant yellow flowers of forsythia arriving in March and April. The flowering stems make good cut flowers, and the shrub itself has a prickly habit that makes this a good plant for hedges and boundary plantings. </p><p>Do not prune this shrub until mid-July. 'Sunrise' is a very cold-resistant plant (down to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit) and some zone 4 gardeners may be able to grow it.</p><p><strong>USDA Growing Zones</strong>: 5–8</p><p><strong>Color Varieties</strong>: Bright yellow</p><p><strong>Sun Exposure:</strong> Full sun to part shade</p><p><strong>Soil Needs</strong>: Loose, medium-moisture, well-drained soil</p><h2>Eastern Redbud (Cercis canadensis)</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Ith1BF-qCrosYUMMMNAQ__eSIVQ=/4288x2848/flowering-dogwood-trees-2131196-06-69db5fdb4a0a4976a3ca514ef18974b4.jpg" alt="Eastern redbud branch with small white and pink flowers closeup" width="4288" height="2848" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><p>As redbuds come into bloom, their limbs appear to grow hairs that are really the beginnings of the flowers. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/key-facts-about-growing-the-eastern-redbud-bush-4122417" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Eastern redbud </a>trees grow to be 20 to 30 feet high with a similar spread.

The RoboVac also has BoostIQ technology, which automatically increases suction when needed, and it can run for up to 100 minutes per charge. </p><p>While this robotic vacuum does a good job of picking up hair and dirt from both hardwood floors and carpets, it’s important to note that this model doesn’t have “floor mapping” technology like more high-tech robot vacuums, so it cleans in a random pattern. </p><p>The Coredy Robot Vacuum Cleaner is a hidden gem, thanks to its impressive cleaning abilities and low price. This vacuum can run for up to 110 minutes per charge, and it boasts an auto-adjusting cleaning head that increases suction when it moves from tile or hardwood floors onto carpets. It has a slim 2.7-inch profile that fits under furniture easily, and it even comes with a remote control that lets you select four cleaning modes and schedule a vacuuming time. Plus, it has a double filter system to more effectively capture dirt and dust as it cleans. </p><p>As powerful as the Coredy Robot Vacuum is, it’s surprisingly quiet. If you’re looking to get the most bang for your buck, you won’t be disappointed in this pick.</p><p>The iRobot Roomba s9+ is the best of the best in the robotic vacuum market, but it doesn’t come cheap. We think this high-end model is worth the splurge thanks to its three-stage cleaning system, home-mapping abilities, and automatic emptying.</p><p>You’ll be blown away by the next-gen technology of the Roomba s9+. It delivers up to 40 times the suction power of previous Roomba models, and when its dust bin is full, it goes back to the charging base to empty itself. This model runs for 120 minutes per charge and has floor-mapping technology, so it can learn, map, and adapt to your home—you’ll be able to tell it to skip a certain room or do a double pass on one area right from your phone. It also comes with a high-efficiency filter that captures 99 percent of mold, pollen, and dust mite allergens. Basically, if you never want to vacuum by hand again, you need this robotic vacuum!</p><p>The Roomba 675 may not be the latest model from iRobot, but it remains a smart pick for a robotic vacuum thanks to its reasonable price, Wi-Fi connectivity, and impressive cleaning performance. This Roomba is effective on hard floors and carpets, and you can control it from your phone, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. </p><p>The Roomba 675 features the brand’s three-stage cleaning system that loosens, lifts, and sucks up small particles and larger debris. It runs for up to 90 minutes per charge and has an edge-sweeping brush that gets dirt out from the edges and corners of the room. There are even dirt detection sensors that let the robot know it needs to focus on certain areas and give them extra passes.</p><p>Anyone who owns pets knows the struggle of trying to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/inexpensive-ways-to-remove-pet-hair-2821474" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">keep hair off of your floor and carpeting</a>. Even if you sweep and vacuum several times a week, you’ll still have balls of hair rolling around under furniture. For this reason, one of the best robotic vacuums for pet owners is the iRobot Roomba i7+, which can be programmed to vacuum on a daily basis and will automatically empty all that pet hair into its base between cleanings.</p><p>This high-end Roomba has a 75-minute runtime and intelligently maps floor plans, and you can control it via your smartphone or smart assistant. It has several features that make it ideal for homes with pets, including its <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/do-i-need-a-hepa-filter-1901189" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">high-efficiency filter</a> and multi-surface rubber brushes that won’t get tangled with pet hair like other brushes. Plus, since it empties its dirt bin into the base—which can hold up to two months of dirt and dust—you won’t have to empty the bin after every cleaning session (even during shedding season).</p><p>Looking for a robotic vacuum that can <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/are-vacuum-cleaners-damaging-to-carpets-1901198" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep your carpets looking pristine</a>? Then you’ll want to check out the Roomba 614, one of the top-rated and most affordable models from the popular brand. It features Roomba’s three-stage cleaning system and dual brushes, which loosen the dirt in your carpet before sucking it up. It has an auto-adjusting cleaning head that adapts to the height of the carpet for optimal performance, and the dirt detection sensors let the vacuum know when the spot needs another pass. </p><p>While this vacuum doesn’t have smart capabilities and it might not serve as a full replacement for your standard vacuum, it works great on carpets for quick cleanups and picks up pet hair like a champ. Just make sure you empty its dust bin regularly, as it may fill up quickly. </p><p>Hands-free vacuuming is one kind of creature comfort, but mopping without having to worry about getting your hands (and feet and clothes, for that matter) wet is a whole new level of luxury. If you dream of getting both of these floor-cleaning tasks done in one remote fell swoop, consider the Roborock S5 MAX, a robotic vacuum that mops as well as it sucks up dirt.</p><p>Through Roborock's corresponding app, you can map out a precise cleaning routine throughout your home (the app can hold up to four floors' worth of data), noting areas it shouldn't mop, areas that need more water than others, and areas it should avoid completely. If you just want the S5 MAX to vacuum, the mop unit detaches easily and the intense suction gets to shine, tackling all varieties of floor surfaces, even high-pile carpet. And, once you set it off on its chores, it will steadily clean for 3 hours, thanks to its lithium-ion battery.</p><p>One of the biggest perks of having a robotic vacuum is that you can watch TV, get work done, or even sleep through the night while it does all the work—but, in order to enjoy that perk, you need a vacuum that won't make a racket while getting the job done. Roborock's E4 model is an excellent option from a performance perspective, but, thanks to its specific Quiet Mode setting, it's also your best chance at getting a clean home without getting distracted from your show or your night's sleep.</p><p>This robotic vacuum cleans thoroughly, moving in tidy rows for up to 200 minutes at a time (if it runs low on juice in the middle of cleaning, it will return to its base, recharge, then go back to where it left off). It easily climbs over doorways and its app comes with a boost setting for carpets. The E4's app also allows you to monitor the cleaning process remotely, start or stop cleaning, and adjust the current mode.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Robot Vacuum</h2><h3>Square footage</h3><p>Do you plan to use your robot vacuum to clean a whole floor of your house or just a few rooms? If you want your vacuum to cover a large amount of square footage, you’ll want a model that has a longer battery life, a larger dust collection bin, and maybe even self-charging capabilities. </p><h3>Carpets</h3><p>Will your robotic vacuum be cleaning hard floors or carpets? Certain products are designed to handle the transition from one floor type to another without losing suction, which will help it clean better on carpets! Other models are designed to be more efficient at picking up pet hair, which is a bonus for those with furry friends. </p><h3>Smart capabilities</h3><p>High-end robot vacuums can connect to Wi-Fi, sending updates to your smartphone. This can be beneficial if you want to be able to start the vacuum remotely or monitor its progress, but keep in mind that this feature will increase the price tag, often by hundreds of dollars.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do robotic vacuums work?</h3><p>Generally, robotic vacuums rely on a variety of sensors to determine their path through your home, and where they should go to clean. Some of these sensors help detect "cliffs," or edges that the machine could fall off, while others sense where objects like furniture are in relation to the vacuum and help it avoid bumping into them. More technologically advanced robotic vacuums may also implement machine learning in order to their cleaning done: Mapping software, customizable cleaning preferences via an integrated app, and dirt sensors provide these smart vacuums with additional information to move through your home without incident and clean the areas that need the most attention.</p><h3>Can a robotic vacuum replace an upright vacuum?</h3><p>If you find the right robotic vacuum for your home, it can do an excellent job keeping your floors clean and end up saving you some time on routine vacuuming. But, you shouldn't toss out your full size vacuum just yet. Where robotic vacuums are highly effective at regularly cleaning floors, including the hard-to-reach corners of your home, they rarely feature the sheer cleaning power that, say, an upright vacuum does. So, when it comes to deep cleaning a high-pile carpet or any vacuuming job that calls for attachments, you're better off sticking with your upright model.</p><h3>How do you keep a robotic vacuum from getting stuck under furniture?</h3><p>Even if you have a smart robotic vacuum, which can learn and adapt to your home's layout, there is always the risk that it will end up stuck under the couch. Luckily, you can prevent this from becoming a recurring issue by choosing a model with a low profile, adding risers to the legs of your furniture, and blocking the way under furniture with string or a virtual barrier. Some models even come equipped with an alert sound you can activate if you lose track of your vacuum's whereabouts.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This roundup was edited by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/kate-geraghty-4772419" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Kate Geraghty</a>, editorial director, commerce home group, who has worked on multiple vacuum roundups for The Spruce.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cleaning your house isn't always the most exciting thing on your to-do list—and when you have a big bulky vacuum, it makes chores even less desirable. If this is a typical scenario in your household you might want to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-buying-guide-1909001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">invest in a canister vacuum</a>.</p><p>Unlike the more popular upright vacuums, canister vacuums are often lighter and easier to maneuver as the wheeled unit glides behind you as you work. The downside is canister vacuums are often better suited for hard floors and often can't tackle high pile rugs so if you have wall-to-wall <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-deep-clean-carpet-4846968" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet</a>, you might want to try an upright vacuum.</p><p>Other things to consider when <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/new-vacuum-cleaner-cost-1901196" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">buying a canister vacuum</a> are if you have allergies or pets. If so, you'll want a model with a HEPA filter and a sealed air filtration system as well as <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-features-1901184" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">specialized attachments</a>.</p><p>Here, the best canister vacuums available now.</p><p>In order to be named the best canister vacuum cleaner, a vacuum can’t sit out on any of the major features it’s expected to have—and it should boast a few bells and whistles that will convince you to choose it over more budget-conscious options. The Kenmore Elite 81714 Pet Friendly Canister Vacuum is that vacuum—one that flies under the radar and then pops up to impress with features like a 2-motor system that gives it exceptional suction strength, an adjustable telescoping wand that can reach and clean up to 10 feet, and a 26-foot cord that offers freedom of movement as you clean and is retractable with the push of button. </p><p>This is a classic bagged canister, which means you will have to replace bags on occasion—but it also means there’s no need to constantly empty filters and wash them out. It was designed with an integrated HEPA filtration system and a special Pet Powermate attachment for sucking up fur and hair from floors, upholstery, and pet areas—a must-have if you have a pet that sheds. Another useful attachment is the dusting and crevice tool with suction control, which can tackle hard floors, carpet, and delicate items like curtains. Make no bones about it: at almost 30 pounds, this is a substantial vacuum and it requires manual pile-height adjustment when you switch from floors to carpet or rugs, but considering its many features, this is the best overall vacuum to own.</p><p>The pursuit of a cleaner home doesn’t have to break the bank. There are a number of double-digit vacuums out there, but the BISSELL Zing Bagged Canister Vacuum stands out for its affordable price tag and plenty of features that don’t force you to compromise on quality. Weighing less than 8 pounds, this bagless vacuum can collect up to 2.5 liters of dirt, dust, and debris. The lightweight vacuum lacks a variety of settings, but it makes up for it with simplicity—one flip of a switch takes you from hard floors to carpet and another adjustable knob lets you lower the suctioning power so that you can safely clean thin rugs, drapes, and upholstery. </p><p>If you have stairs, you’ll appreciate this vacuum’s integrated carrying handle and telescopic wand. And there’s good news for anyone who can’t stand wrapping and uncoiling cords—this model boasts a 15-foot power cord with an automatic cord rewind that retracts when you push one button.</p><p>If you’re ready to take the leap and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-buying-guide-1909001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">splurge</a> on an incredible canister vacuum cleaner that stands the test of time, it doesn’t get better than the Miele Compact C2 Electro + PowerLine. This is the vacuum that checks the boxes for nearly every important vacuum feature—and can be trusted to do an incredible job of gently cleaning hard floors and deep cleaning carpets. This powerful vacuum delivers 1,200 watts of suction power and features two different brush types: use the soft parquet brush to clean hard floors without scratching surfaces and swap it for the electrobrush when you need to get every last stray hair out of your carpet. The cherry on top? The electrobrush adjusts to five different heights to suit a variety of carpet types. </p><p>You don’t have to worry about this vacuum making a racket—its Vortex silence motor gives it a more muffled sound than most vacuums. You can control the amount of suction power via a simple-to-operate 6-setting rotary dial and the three accessories that are included—a crevice tool, upholstery tool, and dusting brush—come clipped to the hose for convenience. Allergy sufferers can breathe easy knowing this Miele vacuum traps over 99.9 percent of dust, dirt, and allergens via its AirClean filter system that includes a dust bag and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/do-i-need-a-hepa-filter-1901189" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEPA AirClean exhaust filter</a>.</p><p>Two of the greatest things about investing in a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/bagless-vs-bagged-vacuum-cleaner-1901195" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">bagless canister</a> vacuum cleaner are knowing that you won’t need to spend another dime on replacement bags and not having to come into close contact with dirt and dust. The Ovente Bagless Canister Vacuum is all about making your life as easy as possible. Its translucent filter and dust container effortlessly lifts up from the canister by a handle and is emptied from the bottom, straight into your garbage. Rinse the filter, replace it, and keep on using your vacuum until a convenient LED light alerts you when the dust container and filter are full. </p><p>This cyclonic vacuum delivers 1200 watts of power and has a HEPA filtration system for capturing allergens, dust, and tiny airborne particles. The automatic cable rewinder keeps you from having to wrap a cord around the vacuum, and a telescopic wand provides access to hard-to-reach areas like the tops of windows, ceilings, and corners. It doesn’t flake out when it comes to attachments, either—you’ll get a pet brush, floor brush, and a combination crevice nozzle and bristle brush.</p><p>The Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Canister Vacuum Cleaner is one of the most powerful vacuums on the market—and one that has gained a reputation for having such forceful suction it can make carpets look brand new, even if you own several dogs that are constantly shedding. Pet owners know the importance of keeping floors, carpet, and their pet areas clean and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/inexpensive-ways-to-remove-pet-hair-2821474" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">free of fur and hair</a>. This vacuum has features that include its trademarked Dyson Cinetic technology for suctioning up and separating microscopic dust and dirt particles, so you can feel confident that it’s getting up all of the debris your pooch or kitty tracks in from the outside (even what you can’t see with the naked eye)—and you don’t have to worry about your vacuum getting jammed up every week. The bagless vacuum is free of filters, which means no extra costs or time spent washing dirty filters. It boasts an ejector lever that drives dirt, hair, and other debris out and straight into your garbage bag so that you never have to pull out gunk with your hands.</p><p>This vacuum’s .42 gallon canister holds a substantial amount of dirt, extending the amount of time you can spend cleaning, and it even self-corrects and picks itself up again if it falls, which saves you time. As with all Dyson ball vacuums, the ball technology allows for ease of movement and steering, which comes in handy when you’re moving around furniture legs and darting in and out of rooms. It has a 21-foot cord and attachments that are stored on the handle, including a turbine head that picks up more dust from hardwood and low-pile carpets and a counter-rotating brush head designed specifically to pull up hair from carpets, upholstery and pet beds.</p><p>One really nice thing about this vacuum is that, if you are a longtime Dyson devotee and are making the switch from Dyson’s upright or another model, this vacuum comes with an adapter that allows you to use transfer attachments over from your previous Dyson vacuum cleaner. It has a whole-machine HEPA filtration system that keeps allergens tucked inside the unit—and has been certified by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.</p><p>Hardwood floors are an investment. The last thing you want to do is scratch and destroy that investment when you’re trying to get your floors <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-wood-floors-4175065" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">as clean as possible</a>. It’s important to keep your floor’s needs in mind when choosing a vacuum—and the Bissell Deluxe Canister Vacuum comes equipped with features that protect hard wood and ease your worries. This 9 pound, bagless vacuum glides along floors on its non marking rubber wheels that feature felt treads. It won’t scratch floors as you go about your cleaning, but it will suction dirt and dust into its 1-liter dirt cup, which is emptied from the bottom to avoid messy situations. </p><p>Whereas some vacuums have cleaning brushes that are more abrasive, this Bissell model comes with a soft, air-driven bristle brush designed to clean hard floors without scraping them. It has digital fingertip controls that let you reduce or increase suction as needed—a rare gem on a model of this price point—and its telescopic 8-foot extension wand is the perfect tool for lifting up debris and dust from <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-all-types-of-curtains-1901080" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">curtains</a> and ceiling fans. If you prefer not to fumble with cords, you’re in luck: it has an automatic cord rewind.</p><p>Thanks to its handle, shoulder strap, and diminutive size (it weighs less than 6 pounds), Oreck's BB1200DB Compact Canister Vacuum can be toted all over the house, no lugging required. And, once cleanup begins, this model proves it's far more than meets the eye: Its combination of suction and versatile attachments (including a crevice tool, upholstery tool, dusting brush, and extension wand) allows it to eliminate dirt and dust throughout a room, from ceiling fans to furniture to baseboards to carpet. The HEPA bagged filtration prevents any of that dust from getting out once it's in and seals upon disposal.</p><p>The BB1200DB can also function as a blower as well as a vacuum, which comes in handy if you need to loosen or dislodge a mess from a tight corner or sticky spot before actually sucking it up. In short, if you want the benefits of a canister vacuum with the portability of a dustbuster, this is the perfect pick for you.</p><p>Sometimes, a mess is so, well, <em>messy</em> that a regular vacuum just won't get the job done. When you're dealing with broken glass, a flooded basement, or dust and debris from a renovation, you're better off opting for a wet/dry canister vacuum, like this tough (but affordable) model from Craftsman. With a 6-gallon collection tank, it's spacious enough to tackle major household cleanups, but its swiveling wheels and overall light weight (15 pounds) prevent it from being unwieldy.</p><p>In addition to a 7-foot hose, this wet/dry vacuum comes with two locking extension wands, a car nozzle for hard-to-reach spaces, and a utility nozzle that works across surfaces. Even the trickiest messes are easily dispatched with when you're using this Craftsman powerhouse.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Canister Vacuum</h2><h3>Power</h3><p>Just how heavy-duty does your vacuum need to be? That depends on the type of floors you have, the size of your home, and other factors, such as if you have pets or not. Things like HEPA filters, which some models include, can also make a vacuum more effective when it comes to trapping allergens like dust and pollen.</p><h3>Size and weight</h3><p>Often, the more powerful a vacuum is, the bigger and heavier it will be—which isn’t ideal if your home has multiple levels. In some cases, you may even want to consider multiple vacuums, so you can keep one on each floor, but there are also some powerful lightweight models that may do the job. </p><h3>Features</h3><p>There’s probably nothing that’s going to make vacuuming your favorite activity, but there are some features that can make it a lot easier. Things like retractable cords and different attachments can help—just think about what matters most to you.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I clean a canister vacuum?</h3><p>If your canister vacuum uses a bag, you'll need to seal, remove, and throw it away. Bagless models will need to be emptied into the trash, most likely via a release button on the canister's body. After you empty the vacuum, wipe out the canister's interior with a microfiber cloth. Some models can be further cleaned using water and dishwashing liquid, but you'll need to check your vacuum's manual to make sure that won't damage the unit. Similarly, you'll either need to replace or rinse off the vacuum's filter. While the vacuum components dry, you can check the cleaning head and wheels for hair wrap and debris. Reassemble once everything is dry.</p><h3>What's the difference between bagged and bagless canister vacuums?</h3><p>In addition to having different emptying processes, bagged and bagless canister vacuums offer different advantages in general. The former tend to seal away allergens more efficiently, while the latter may be more cost-effective in the long run, since they don't require replacement bags. Both offer plenty in the way of performance and cleaning power, however, so which type you choose is mostly a matter of personal preference.</p><h3>What do I look for in suction power on a canister vacuum cleaner?</h3><p>There are undoubtedly some seriously powerful canister vacuums on the market—and many are designed to keep pace with their upright counterparts. Nevertheless, you may need to temper your expectations around suction if you're hoping to clean, say, a high-pile carpet with a canister vacuum. Some models just won't be powerful enough to tackle that kind of job. If suction power is your absolute top priority and you're set on purchasing a canister vacuum, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/do-vacuum-cleaner-amps-mean-power-1901194" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">look for models</a> with multiple fans, adjustable height settings, and a high cubic feet per minute (CFM) count, which will give you an idea of how much airflow the vacuum is capable of.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was edited and updated by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keeping a car in good shape takes a lot of routine maintenance and cleaning. While most people focus on the outside of their car or what’s under the hood, you can't ignore <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-car-interior-4775265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">the car’s interior</a> if you want to maximize its value and lifespan. A car’s interior quickly <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-car-mats-4177783" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">collects dust, debris, oils, and more</a> as it is driven on a daily basis. For a quick and routine cleaning, you'll need a car vacuum.</p><p>Like home vacuums, these cleaning tools come in many shapes and sizes. Tending to be smaller and less powerful, you will need to decide between the consistent performance and limited range of a corded vacuum or the limited use, but greater range of a battery-powered option. You should also keep an eye on the different accessories a vacuum offers to make the cleaning quicker and easier, like attachments for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-cloth-car-seats-4693504" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">upholstery</a> or small corners of your car.</p><p>Here, the best car vacuums on the market.</p><p>While you should not expect a lot of suction and power out of a car vacuum compared to traditional household options, the best car vacuums will not leave you hanging when it comes time to clean the car. In fact, a good car vacuum balances power, suction consistency, and portability so you can weave your way around a car’s interior effortlessly anytime you need or want.</p><p>The Hotor 4th Gen Car Vacuum takes the top spot for the portability and reliability it offers when you need to clean the car quickly anytime, anywhere. The vacuum comes with a small but powerful motor capable of a 4.5kPa suction level that will take care of most dust and small debris. Using the car’s 12V plug, you can plug the vacuum in and use it anywhere, even on the road. </p><p>While it may be nice to have a pet beside you during a drive, your car’s interior may suffer from more hair and dirt. Pet hair can be a challenge to remove for most vacuums, but Bissell's Pet Hair Eraser is a powerful handheld vacuum with a specialized array of accessories to clean up after your furry friend. While the motorized brush tool dredges up embedded messes, the upholstery tool cleans up your car's seats, and the crevice tool removes pesky messes in between seats and in corners.</p><p>In addition to its attachments, this cordless vacuum is equipped with a lithium ion battery, which keeps it running for up to 17 minutes at a time. With unwavering suction and a three-level filtration system, this model from Bissell can handle messes from even the most excessive shedders.</p><p>Saving money on a vacuum can mean sacrificing suction and battery life for the sake of a bargain. But IonVac's handheld vacuum comes at a fair price and runs for an intense 20 minutes before needing a recharge. This model features a sleek appearance, USB-chargeable battery, and relatively high-capacity dust cup given its diminutive size. Clocking in at less than three pounds and 13 inches long, this car vacuum is small but mighty, with surprising suction power.</p><p>This model's slight design allows it to reach tight spaces around your car's interior. And anything it can't reach on its own is made accessible with the help of the included crevice tool. It also comes with a soft hose and dust brush attachment, so the areas under and around your seats won't go uncleaned.</p><p>With twice the suction power as Hoover's regular ONEPWR dustbuster and a battery life of 35 minutes, this little vacuum is an unexpected workhorse. It's a great pick if you're willing to spend a little more money on your next car vacuum.</p><p>The Hoover ONEPWR Dust Chaser comes with an extendable nozzle and a 2-in-1 crevice and dusting brush, allowing it to efficiently clean narrow spaces, floor mats, and upholstery. Plus, it weighs less than three pounds, so even longer cleanups won't feel like chores. The dual stage HEPA media filter captures 97.9 percent of dust, dirt, and allergens and the 3.84-ounce dirt cup releases and empties with ease. This model's suction won't fade with use and its filter can be rinsed and reused. If you're looking for a high-quality car vacuum that's built with small spaces in mind, this option from Hoover is a worthy investment.</p><p>SUVs present a unique challenge when cleaning since they have larger interiors and more space to cover. The main challenge with many car vacuums and SUV interiors is the cord. A limited cord length means you only have a small range to clean unless your SUV has multiple 12V outlets in the back rows. This is where a vacuum with an extra long cord comes in handy. The Black+Decker Flexi Automotive Vacuum takes a unique approach to vehicle vacuum design. Featuring cyclonic suction often found on larger vacuums, this option creates a consistent and continuous air suction that is not affected by larger dust and debris. The included hose and pivoting nozzle make it easy to reach in between seats and into cracks when necessary as well. Finally, the 16-foot cable is perfect for larger vehicles.</p><p>Those who want to be ready to pick up a mess at a moment’s notice may be best served by keeping a smaller vacuum right in their car. Bissell’s AeroSlim model is a handy, compact option that’s small enough to fit in the trunk, back seat, or glove compartment. The two-in-one crevice tool and brush attachment stores alongside the vacuum for maximum space efficiency and reaches dirt and dust under, around, and even in the car’s seats.</p><p>Despite this model’s diminutive size, it boasts powerful suction and a 12-minute battery life. Users can charge it through a regular power outlet or a USB port if they’re on the go.</p><p>With the right attachments, you can clean every corner of your car, not just the mats and seats. The ThisWorx Portable Car Vacuum Cleaner provides users with all the necessary tools to clean their vehicle’s interior from top to bottom, with a 16-foot power cord to make it happen. Its flathead nozzle creates a small profile for cracks and under the seats. Its extension tube reaches deep under the seats. Finally, its brush head is perfect for getting clinging hairs and larger debris out of the seats and mats without needing a full-size vacuum.</p><p>In addition to its attachments, ThisWorx’s model empties cleanly into the trash and comes with a filter-cleaning brush, plus an extra HEPA filter when the time comes to replace the current one.</p><p>The only downside to most car vacuums is the lack of power they have compared to other suction devices. For ​really dirty cars, you may need something with a larger capacity and more powerful motor. Wet/dry vacuums, often found in homes and wood shops for better suction, are the perfect option for a good, deep clean. When designed for use in a car, this type of vacuum is the best choice for tough jobs.</p><p>The Ridgid 4 Gallon Wet Dry Vac is the tool to choose when nothing else will get the job done. As a wet/dry vacuum, the motor offers 5 horsepower which overshadows the normal handheld options you will find for the car. In addition to its sheer cleaning power, this vacuum's extension hose and 20-foot power cord provide ample reach to get a deep clean of the seats and the car's interior overall. </p><h2>What to Look for in a Car Vacuum</h2><h3>Weight</h3><p>For a handheld cleaning tool like a car vacuum, weight is a key feature to take into consideration before you make your final purchase. Most models should be relatively lightweight, especially corded models that aren't laden with a rechargeable battery. Meanwhile, cordless car vacuums, as well as ones that come with an array of accessories, may weigh slightly more and, therefore, be a little more cumbersome to handle while cleaning.</p><h3>Power source</h3><p>Most car vacuums can plug directly into your car's 12V outlet, making them a breeze to take with you and clean on the go. Of course, these models are corded, which limits their reach and mobility. If you opt for a cordless option instead, make sure to consider its battery life and how it recharges. Some models can recharge via USB port, while others will need access to a conventional household outlet.</p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>If you hope to use this vacuum for deep cleaning, make sure it has the attachments to get the job done. A crevice tool can access tight spaces, an extension hose can reach under seats, and an upholstery brush can dredge up ground-in dirt from seats and floor mats. A model that lacks these accessories might not be able to clean your vehicle as thoroughly as you'd like.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I clean a car vacuum?</h3><p>Like any other handheld vacuum or dustbuster, your car vacuum likely has a dust cup or bag that you should be able to access, remove, and empty with relative ease. Beyond that, check your car vacuum's manual to determine whether its filter is washable or needs to be replaced. The manual should also note whether it's safe to clean out the interior with soap and water or if you should only use a dust rag. If you wash it with water, let all of its components dry before reassembling.</p><h3>How do I use a car vacuum to clean between the car seats?</h3><p>If messes tend to accumulate in the spaces between your car's seats, a car vacuum with the right set of attachments will come in handy—make sure your model of choice comes with a crevice tool and an extension hose, both of which will allow you to reach tight spaces that the vacuum's main body can't. In addition to these useful attachments, a can of compressed air, which can blow fine debris out of even the smallest spaces, is a great supplementary cleaning tool. However, if you have the time, the most efficient way to clean around your car's seats is to remove them completely, then put your car vacuum to work.</p><h3>Will using a car vacuum wear down my car's battery?</h3><p>If your car vacuum of choice relies on your car's 12V outlet for power, you might be concerned that running it will drain the car's battery. This is, indeed, a risk, but it will depend on how powerful your battery is, how long you vacuum for, and how weak or old your car's battery is. It's unlikely that a quick cleanup will completely deplete your battery, but if you're worried or vacuuming the whole interior, you might be better off starting the car and letting it run while you clean—if for no other reason than for your peace of mind.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

If not, you can use various apps to determine yours. It’s part of your birth chart, and one of the three main determinants of your personality: sun, moon, and rising. </p><h2>What Is a Moon Sign?</h2><p>Your moon sign is your inner world. It rules your emotions and reveals who you are when you’re alone (or among your closest inner circle). Your moon sign also determines what your comfort zones are, dictating what you need in order to feel both safe and secure. </p><p>If any place in your home should be your safe space, it’s your bedroom. Each moon sign has different needs for their bedroom. Read on below to get some ideas of how to design your perfect bedroom based on whatever your moon sign is. </p><h2>Aries Moon</h2><p>An Aries moon is an impulsive, feisty spirit. They’re always on the go, and their bedroom should be functional and frill-free to keep the Aries moon moving from their waking hours to bedtime with ease. An Aries moon dreams best in a room created with minimal design with bright details. Think a sensible comforter with a few colorful throw pillows, a seasonally curated clothing rack, and a perfectly organized dresser. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/T4gMwVEFcDY4OO36E0PpmaZHB4Q=/4500x3000/style-your-dresser-top-like-a-pro-350703-03-9929b19f94d9444ca2fb5dd7ee4e1e36-e2fcc47fe4e0422a93e64e1874e41b5a.jpeg" alt="Organized, stylish dresser top" width="4500" height="3000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Niv Rozenberg & Aubrey Hays</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Taurus Moon</h2><p>A Taurus moon feels most secure with the earth <em>right </em>beneath their feet, grounding themselves in daily routines and nurturing, supportive relationships. A Taurus moon feels most at ease in cozy, stable situations and surroundings. As such, a Taurus moon bedroom should be designed in such a way that makes settling into bed after a long day a breeze. Some ways a Taurus moon can bring in a sense of calm into their bedroom include hanging photos of loved ones, decorating with earthy elements like macrame or house plants, and keeping crystals charged and on their dresser or nightstand.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/JtaBEiRKik4n2Jdg46zU3sXuYbU=/5460x3640/cole-keister-ZN9LhLYCVko-unsplash-418a685d18bd46e28de627c0033e53fc.jpg" alt="Earthy bedroom decor" width="5460" height="3640" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Cole Keister / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Gemini Moon</h2><p>A Gemini moon is a constant state of reinvention. A restless being, a Gemini moon needs a space that invites rebirth and evolution. Making sure their room feels as wide as their horizons is imperative. Hanging curtains higher to make the room feel bigger, a large mirror placed intentionally across from a window, and tons of room to roam are perfect for a Gemini room. The less clutter, the better.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/t9-IFM2PkwQO7_iMH4NOaIoGuto=/866x578/Stocksy_txp8a04d4dd57n200_Small_2598444-f431cecc030243f09daa2e8573266f9d.jpg" alt="unique bedroom with a mirror facing a window" width="866" height="578" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jess Craven / Stocksy</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Cancer Moon</h2><p>A Cancer moon needs a bedroom that’s all about coziness. A fluffy comforter, soft mood lighting, walls painted in soft hues, and plenty of throw pillows will make a Cancer feel relaxed and secure. Oh, and don’t forget a soft rug! A Cancer moon needs every part of their bedroom to feel as comfortable as possible.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/OqsYMcPBVXWGVaOjEu_JPQchcoA=/1733x1155/Stocksy_txp6145e527HXb200_Medium_25216961-e14244ab62df4c9081723cee54de9420.jpg" alt="calm, cozy bedroom decor" width="1733" height="1155" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Leah Flores / Stocksy</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Leo Moon</h2><p>A Leo moon is all about the finer, intricate things in life. Forget minimalism, a Leo moon needs everything to be maxed out. An ornate chandelier, a statement mirror, and tons of color are what will make a Leo moon feel most alive. Don’t be afraid to make every space have some element of styling. A Leo moon doesn’t see this as clutter but necessary noise. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/jogGDXXRapm2DMBbY5V7C_jBhRA=/6912x3888/spacejoy-9xoQJ-3-HGs-unsplash-7421dcb6cb52490cbbdc1ad155e6741d.jpg" alt="Colorful, maximalist bedroom decor" width="6912" height="3888" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Spacejoy / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Virgo Moon</h2><p>A Virgo moon needs two things to feel at home in their bedroom: organization and rustic style. Everything should always be in its proper place, everything should have a use, and everything should look earthy and beautiful while it’s at it. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/fCKuC2SWijLfpevmk2ZN6qmnRYg=/2500x1667/BlackRockScarboroughMaineMasterBedroomSuite-82dcf4cb0aee4632a617d1615475ea25.jpeg" alt="Rustic, organized bedroom" width="2500" height="1667" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Tyler Karu Designs</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Libra Moon</h2><p>A Libra moon is all about balance. Keeping this in mind, a Libra bedroom should adhere to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/feng-shui-tips-for-your-bed-and-bedroom-4121839" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">feng shui principles</a> to keep the energy of the room just right. Their bed in the commanding position, plenty of house plants, and a carefully chosen color scheme are all perfect elements to make a Libra bedroom perfect for them. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/lZ4sL1JpxmxSW9NoCYfEnXrdqTE=/640x427/master-bedroom-nursery-makeover8-1-7d0ec5dd6a7748f2afba8b91c706d465.jpeg" alt="Bedroom with bed in the commanding position" width="640" height="427" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Sarah Sherman Samuel</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Scorpio Moon</h2><p>A Scorpio moon is all about emotional intensity. They crave depth in their relationships and within their own mind. Forget material belongings, a Scorpio moon becomes most alive in the spaces that invite emotion. A Scorpio moon’s bedroom should reflect this. A reading corner with a bookshelf stocked with their favorite tearjerkers, moody lighting, beautiful and meaningful framed art prints, and intricate curtains all will help a Scorpio moon settle into bed after a long day. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/UeZdU3rJ4DHWxP90I65_HWiVWUY=/1804x1289/1026_17-90177c686c874d08b09007e164a121d8.jpeg" alt="Moody bedroom decor" width="1804" height="1289" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Devon Grace Interiors</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Sagittarius Moon</h2><p>A Sagittarius moon desires adventure. In fact, a Sag moon 100 percent requires it. A fierce lover of travel and learning about experiences different than their own, A Sagittarius moon’s bedroom should be a nod to these passions. A map with the places they’ve been (and want to visit), a bookshelf full of informative reads, and tons of trinkets from their travels are perfect for a Sagittarius moon’s bedroom. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/CWsVfEPhEbDf3icCPL9SOn2Hq4M=/1024x683/Nantucket_KMD_9-1024x683-7bb4332d23b84a0d92d13a7680486fb6-993ab2705510430688b16dce3f9f3fc8.jpeg" alt="Bedroom with bookshelf and travel trinkets" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Katie Martinez Design</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Capricorn Moon</h2><p>A Capricorn moon craves solitude. They refuel best during the moments they get to spend solo. What better place to do that, then, then their bedroom? Beyond that, though, a Capricorn is practical. Everything must have a purpose. A Capricorn moon should design their room for maximum productivity. A minimal, traditional aesthetic will work great.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/JLEzS4-LWWxT5JFppzCtzgyVJNA=/2500x1667/Interiors929-471-dbe4b58200084894a762414c9bce7d85.jpeg" alt="Minimalist bedroom decor" width="2500" height="1667" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Cathie Hong Interiors</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Aquarius Moon</h2><p>An Aquarius moon is two things: unique and unusual. Their bedroom should be a reflection of their zaniness, their need to be different. Peculiar passions, unexpected color schemes, odd knick knacks should all be on display. An Aquarius doesn’t follow a typical blueprint when it comes to interior design; it just has to make sense to them and them alone. After all, every Aquarius moon is their own. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/jfK2AYXb0I-tbK7ukkz3PehXCK4=/2560x1707/caz-bedroom-1b-scaled-6c8aa0757b594ba4999d2e38230dc4e0.jpeg" alt="Quirky, unique bedroom" width="2560" height="1707" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Anne Sage</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Pisces Moon</h2><p>A Pisces moon is the dreamiest of the lunar signs. Sure, this might make them a little detached from reality but it makes space for big aspirations and even bigger hopes. Their bedroom should be a space that encourages huge thoughts. A Pisces moon is intuitive, so focusing on details that encourage this sign of them will help a Pisces feel most like themselves. A star ceiling projector, nods to their big dreams in the form of art prints, and a journaling corner are all excellent ways to make a Pisces moon bedroom perfect for them. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/z32ll2jT7-YqHs4Z-aj5Uf3Gmuo=/5832x3888/spacejoy-qGNgjHQjO2k-unsplash-c483874a09fe4ce7a5bc10a28981d665.jpg" alt="Airy bedroom decor with corner nook" width="5832" height="3888" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Spacejoy / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Bm7d14Rd2kbn___84NZpQFED6Gc=/1925x1558/200278881-001-56a349f43df78cf7727cb914.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Couple planting bulbs in ground" width="1925" height="1558" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Debra McClinton/The Image Bank/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many of the most familiar bulbs are spring-blooming species, but in order to bloom, these spring-bloomers need to be planted several months earlier. The general rule of thumb is that <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/spring-blooming-bulbs-1402261" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">spring-blooming bulbs</a> require a period of cold-chilling and thus should be planted in the fall. But fall is a long season, and some bulbs require a more precise planting time within the fall window.</p><h2>Considerations for Planting Spring-Blooming Bulbs</h2><p>There is no perfect moment, calendar-wise, for planting bulbs. The ideal time to plant your spring bulbs depends on where you live and seasonal weather conditions.</p><p>To <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-dormancy-1403075" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">break dormancy</a> and ensure flowering, most of the more common spring-blooming bulbs (like tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, and crocus) must be exposed to temperatures of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (or colder) for at least 12 to 14 weeks. Exposing bulbs to these cold temperatures stimulates them to turn on flower formation and initiates root growth. Most spring-flowering bulbs must be planted in soil for several weeks before the ground freezes for their root systems to develop.</p><p>Planting these bulbs too early in the fall can be detrimental because the bulbs may start to sprout too early. Sending up foliage too early depletes the energy that a bulb needs to get through the winter and bloom in spring. So, if your area is experiencing a long summer and temperatures are still quite warm at the beginning of fall, hold off planting until temperatures begin to cool down.</p><p>Here are the general rules of thumb for planting spring-blooming bulbs:</p><ul><li>Gardeners in the coldest USDA Zones (1 to 4) should plant bulbs in late August and early September. Don't wait for the official start of fall on the calendar to plant your bulbs.</li><li>Gardeners in Zones 5 to 7 can't trust the calendar either. You must wait to plant your bulbs until temperatures cool down, especially during the day. Temperatures might start to cool in September in some years, in October in other years. It's better to err on the later side. You can even plant bulbs into November and beyond if the ground has not yet frozen.</li><li>Gardeners in warmer climates, Zones 8 and higher, need to purchase <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/spring-blooming-bulbs-for-warmer-climates-4144970" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">pre-chilled bulbs</a> for the best success. Winters in warmer climates are not cold enough for the bulbs to receive the chilling period they require.</li></ul><h2>If You Forget to Plant Bulbs in the Fall</h2><p>The guidelines mentioned here are the ideal planting times, but sooner or later every gardener buys bulbs and then forgets about them or doesn’t get around to planting at the ideal time. Take heart; all is not lost.</p><p>Most bulbs on the store shelves were dug early in the summer and then stored for shipping. If the bulbs you forgot to plant are still plump and firm in later fall or early winter, they’re still viable and can be planted. Storing bulbs out of soil all winter will cause them to wither and die. The important point is to plant your bulbs in the soil as soon as possible.</p><h3>Before the Ground Freezes</h3><p>The old adage says that “As long as you can get your shovel in the ground, you can plant your bulbs.” It’s hard to believe, but they are better off in frosty soil than they are sitting in your garage or basement. Spring bulbs have been known to send out roots in soil that’s just above freezing. So if you’re planting late in the season, plant as deeply as possible, even a few inches deeper than recommended. Once the ground freezes solid, mulch the bulbs with a few inches of leaves, straw, or some evergreen boughs. It might take longer in spring for the shoots to surface from the extra depth, but eventually, they will.</p><h3>After the Ground Has Frozen</h3><p>Once the ground has frozen and the soil is too hard to dig, you might be tempted to toss your bulbs into a dark corner of the basement and forget about them until spring. But spring-blooming bulbs are not like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/growing-and-caring-for-dahlias-1402255" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">dahlias</a>, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/gladiolus-flowers-1315704" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">gladioli</a>, or other <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/planting-summer-bulbs-1403188" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">summer-blooming tender bulbs</a> that can be <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/storing-tender-bulbs-for-the-winter-1402232" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">stored away for winter</a>. Remember, spring-blooming bulbs need to develop some roots and experience a period of chilling to be able to sprout and flower next season. Bulbs only have enough energy stored to get them through one dormant season. They need to grow next year to replenish themselves, so you really need to get them into soil somehow.</p><p>You have two options if you find yourself in the predicament where the soil has frozen and you can't dig:</p><ul><li><strong>Pot them up.</strong> Plant the bulbs in large containers filled with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/potting-soil-indoor-plants-container-plants-1902802" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">potting soil</a>. Plant the bulbs at the proper depth in the container, and make sure the bulbs are not pressed up against the sides of the pot where they can freeze. For proper insulation, there must be plenty of soil between the pot sides and the bulbs. Store the pot in an unheated garage, porch, or even a basement window well. The bulbs need to be properly chilled but not exposed to extremes. Water the pot lightly once a month if it dries out, but don’t allow the soil to remain wet. Move the pot outdoors in mid-spring and either let the bulbs bloom in the pot or transplant them into your garden once they have sprouted. Transplanting into the garden will give the bulbs more time to establish themselves and become stronger for next year.</li><li><strong>If you can’t dig into the ground, plant on top of it.</strong> Spread your bulbs out on top of the ground and then cover them with at least 6 to 8 inches of added potting soil.

<description><![CDATA[The perfect storage shed should be durable and keep your gear organized. We researched the best options so you can find the right one for your needs.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing ruins the mood in your perfectly crafted backyard like clutter and mess. If you are looking to get your lawn and garden maintenance items out of sight, an outdoor storage shed may be just the solution. Creating a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-create-a-more-relaxing-backyard-4121173" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">relaxing outdoor space</a> requires maintenance and work, but that doesn’t mean that your tools need to be the only ones able to enjoy space in your yard.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/considerations-when-buying-outdoor-storage-sheds-2130776" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">looking for the perfect outdoor shed</a>, consider what you need to store and how to best keep it organized and accessible. Outdoor storage sheds come in a variety of sizes, materials, and configurations, so there is sure to be something that meets your needs and budget.</p><p>Here, the best outdoor storage sheds to keep you organized.</p><p>Most homeowners need a shed that will store their gardening and lawn maintenance equipment, be easy to maintain, and simple to assemble. The MCombo Outdoor 3 ft. W x 2 ft. D Solid Wood Lean-To Storage Shed fits the bill. Made of solid fir, this shed is as attractive as it is functional. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-choose-outdoor-wood-furniture-1391748" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">solid wood construction</a> is mildew and water-resistant. It has an included floor, which will deter pests and bugs from getting to your stored items.</p><p>The shed fits a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lawn-mower-buying-guide-4173444" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">standard push lawn mower</a>, has shelves to store smaller items like pots or handheld garden tools, and has a locking door to keep everything secure. If you have larger items, like a riding lawn mower, you will need a bigger shed and should even consider something with windows or skylights for additional light inside.</p><p>If you are renting or just need some temporary storage, an outdoor storage tent is a great alternative to a traditional shed. This model from YardStash uses heavy-duty vinyl tarpaulin to keep your items safe and secure, protecting them from rain, sun, dirt, and pests. It comes with a carrying bag so you can move the tent shed to a different location or even take it camping. It fits two adult bikes plus a few additional items in the included pockets. You can also use it for a lawnmower, but if you’re looking for large walk-in storage, this isn’t the option for you.</p><p>For those who need a large storage capacity, this 15 x 8 x 7-foot shed can store everything that you need. It includes two windows with shutters, six skylights, two vents, two peg strips, two main shelves, and four corner shelves. This outdoor shed is more like a separate structure than a shed.</p><p>This is a pricey shed but if you are looking for a shed that can hold everything you need, it’s worth the investment. Plan on spending at least a full day assembling the shed if you have two people. It may be worth paying for professional construction. Made from dual-wall UV-protected high-density polyethylene with steel wall supports, it will last for years and is easy to maintain.</p><p>If a homey aesthetic is important to you, a wood shed kit from Outdoor Living Today is a great option. This 9 foot by 6-foot shed is perfect to store your lawn tools, but it can be a focal point in your yard as well. Because this is a kit, all pieces come pre-cut and ready for assembly.</p><p>This kit has a lot included, which likely accounts for the high price. The Outdoor Living Today Cabana 9 ft. x 6 ft. Wooden Storage Shed includes all of the lumber needed to construct the shed, shingles, two windows, flower boxes, a floor, and ventilation. It is made of natural, unfinished <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/keep-cedar-wood-protected-4125926" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">cedar</a>, which is mold and mildew-resistant. This feature, along with its attractive, natural look, makes cedar a popular option for yards. You will need to put this shed on a foundation, which will need to be poured separately.</p><p>This metal storage shed has a generous size, four vents, and two doors. The sloped roof is designed to keep snow and rain from accumulating and the painted metal is both durable and attractive. It looks like a utilitarian shed, which it is, but has a solid basic construction and will last for years.</p><p>One of the noteworthy features of this metal storage shed from Outsunny is the sliding door. If you don’t want to designate space in your landscaping for a shed door that swings out, you will love the design of this shed’s entry. The door slides into the interior on a track, saving you precious space.</p><p>Storing items close to your outdoor entertaining space can be very helpful but you may not need a full walk-in shed. This horizontal shed from Symple Stuff can keep patio chair cushions, umbrellas, grill tools, and even serving dishes close at hand without taking up a lot of space. Made of polypropylene resin, all it takes is a hose and water to maintain.</p><p>The doors open and the top lifts up to allow easy access to everything stored inside. Remember that this is not a walk-in storage shed, so large items like lawn mowers are better left for other sheds or the garage. This storage solution is perfect for small items that you need to keep close by but out of sight. It makes a great place to store garbage or recycling cans when not in use.</p><p>This popular outdoor shed made by the well-known home storage company Rubbermaid doesn’t have a lot of fancy features but includes just what you need to store just about anything in your yard in an easy-to-assemble kit. The shed comes delivered to your door and only requires one person to put it together.</p><p>The doors open a full 180 degrees to provide plenty of space for riding lawn mowers, power equipment, or other large items to go into the shed. There aren’t any included shelves, but you can add them later. Compatible accessories from Rubbermaid, such as hooks, shelves, and storage baskets, make it easy to customize the interior of your shed.</p><p>If you want your shed to function as a mini-retreat in addition to keeping your things organized, this adorable shed from Little Cottage Company looks more like a cottage than a utilitarian space to hold lawn equipment. It comes in a ready-to-assemble kit with all pre-cut parts. All you need to add are shingles, a drip edge, and paint. The kit even includes a flower box and decorative cupola for maximum curb appeal.</p><p>This is an expensive storage shed, so if you don’t need the extra details or ample storage space, you’ll probably be happier with a more basic model. For those looking to create a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/homey-sheds-that-transform-outdoor-space-3017228" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">backyard oasis</a>, this is an investment that you will love.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Outdoor Storage Shed</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>Outdoor storage sheds can be categorized by recommended use, such as garden sheds or tool sheds, or by shape, such as vertical sheds or horizontal sheds. High-quality garden and tool sheds tend to have interior shelving, either included with the shed assembly kit or available as an add-on purchase from the manufacturer. </p><p>Outdoor storage sheds can come with or without windows. The larger sheds that are suitable for large items or as an enclosed workspace usually have multiple windows and vents to provide airflow and light. </p><h3><strong><br></strong>Size</h3><p>Determining the best size for your outdoor storage shed will depend on both your intended use and available outdoor space. For <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/small-backyard-landscaping-ideas-4691367" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">small spaces</a> and decks, a storage box or vertical storage shed can provide a lot of space with a small footprint. In larger yards, an enclosed structure may better meet your needs.</p><p>When selecting a site for your outdoor storage shed make sure that you account for the space in front of the shed that is required to open the doors. This is especially important if you need to open the doors to their maximum capacity to get large items like riding lawn mowers inside the shed. Some sheds have sliding doors, which may provide an alternative for your space.</p><h3><strong><br></strong>Material</h3><p>Outdoor storage sheds can be constructed from resin or durable plastic, wood, or metal. Some portable sheds are made with flexible tarp materials that can be easily put up and taken down. You should consider your climate and how much exposure to the elements that you expect your shed to weather when selecting a material. Some require additional upkeep and maintenance, while others are almost maintenance-free.</p><p>Heavy rain can quickly make a mess inside your storage shed if you haven’t taken this aspect of your climate into account when selecting a shed. Look for something that is elevated and includes a floor. You can also put your storage shed on a foundation, just make sure that your yard is graded to slope rainwater away from the structure. A sloped roof is another useful feature to keep rain and snow from accumulating up top.</p><h3>Climate/Environment</h3><p>Resin is usually the lowest maintenance option. Look for something that has been treated to be UV resistant so that it does not fade quickly. For large structures, steel support beams should be inside to reinforce the roof and other structural elements. Wood sheds offer a more traditional look but may require additional upkeep, such as paint, stain, or sealant. Metal options are usually cheaper but may not be as long-lasting as their resin counterparts, although they are still a durable option.</p><p>For those with high winds, a smaller storage shed can easily be moved or even taken up by a strong gust. Storage sheds usually have a wind rating recommendation, so look for something that can stay secure in your area. </p><p>Some sheds have space for insulation. For those who live in hot or cold areas and plan to use their shed as a workspace, taking the time to insulate the structure can keep it comfortable for you and increase the longevity of equipment that you store inside.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/katie-begley-4693290" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Katie Begley</a>, who values storage and organization in every area of her home.

<title>The 8 Best Hammers of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/__0h_0aXg1ZwSgXTQeyZV9I_cqU=/656x1500/StanleyFatMax-59b2ba63054ad90011e5c92a.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[There are many types of hammers from light to heavyweight, but the best are durable and fit your hand well. We researched the best hammers for your needs.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to a screwdriver, your hammer is likely the most reached-for item in <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/must-have-tools-for-home-workshop-1398325" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">your toolbox</a>. While most often used to drive nails or pull them back out, hammers are actually very versatile tools. Depending on the design and weight, you can use a hammer to drive much larger objects than nails, such as spikes. And of course, you can use the right hammer for demolition, to break apart rocks or concrete, to shape metal, or even to apply force to a delicate surface that you don’t want marred. </p><p>While the basics of hammers are simple—they consist of a wooden, metal, or fiberglass handle with a metal head used for striking other objects—there are a lot of different hammer types and designs out there. It should be noted that hammers often are classified by weight, but that weight refers to the weight of the metal head, <strong>not </strong>the weight of the entire tool.</p><p>We researched a wide variety of the most popular hammers available today, and then whittled the choices down to those we feel are the best suited to the average DIYer, renter, or homeowner looking to tackle various tasks around their home.</p><p>Here are the best hammers available now.</p><p>Stanley is a big name among tool manufacturers, so it's only natural that their 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme takes the top spot for good hammers to buy. This one goes beyond what most hammers offer in design and build. While it easily can drive nails into hard and thick woods with its 16-ounce, all-steel construction, it does it in a way that is meant to protect the user.</p><p>Hammering <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-properly-using-a-hammer-1825125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeatedly </a>can lead to many problems with hands and wrists over time. The vibrations of each impact can stress the bones and tendons holding everything together. If you will be using a hammer a lot, this one minimizes the dangers by absorbing most of the impact of each strike. The handle is also designed to reduce the torque placed on the wrists and elbows as you swing.</p><p>The toughest hammer isn't always the best for some projects. If you are looking for a versatile hammer to use for more delicate projects, the Tekton 30812 Double-Faced Soft Mallet will get the job done. The dual soft faces—one side is black rubber and the other is red plastic—are better for hitting surfaces you don't want to damage as you apply a lot of force to each strike. This is perfect for protecting fragile surfaces or completed finishes while you hammer.</p><p>The body of the hammer is meant to keep the whole tool light if you need something that you can comfortably carry and use for long periods of time. The shaft and handle are made of tubular steel, which reduces the overall weight of the tool. The soft, rubber grip will also keep the hammer comfortably planted in your hands while you swing and strike.</p><p>Sometimes, finding a good hammer is a matter of personal preference. For some people, nothing can quite compare to the feel and weight of a wooden-handled hammer when it's time to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/nail-sizes-and-types-1824836" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive nails</a> home. Wood is old-school technology, but with hammers like the Stanley 51-106, it still has a lot to offer. It offers a level of ergonomic customization that metal and rubber simply can’t match. And when the price is this reasonable, so much the better.</p><p>Like other wood handles, the 51-106 will change to fit your grip the more you use it as the wood slowly wears over time. Don’t worry; this is natural and rarely compromises the overall strength of the hammer. The wood is heat treated and polished to a visual shine to increase its overall strength. The shaft is also tempered in its weak spots to reduce the possibility of chipping and splitting the wood as you strike.</p><p>The IIT 32380 12-Ounce Stubby is meant for light-duty projects where you will find yourself hammering for hours on end. The lightweight, ergonomic handle is covered in a soft rubber comfort-grip that will work for both right and left handed individuals, and the stubby size makes this tool ideal for working in confined quarters, or carrying out around-the-house repairs and simple carpentry tasks.</p><p>When it comes to weight, the Stubby is just right: at 12 ounces, it isn't too heavy nor is it too light. The steel head is strong enough to survive repeated abuse for long projects, while the weight is convenient for the times you need a little extra force in your swing. At 8 inches in length, it is also a perfect size for carrying around on your toolbelt when not in use.</p><p>If pounding in nails to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-perfectly-placed-art-1976086" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">hang pictures</a> is just about the most action your hammer ever sees, there’s no need for a heavy tool made for more rigorous tasks. Instead, a lightweight hammer like the Olympia Tools 8-Ounce Wood Claw Hammer gets the job done very effectively, but with less wear-and-tear on your hands and wrists, and less potential damage to your walls should you misjudge your swing.</p><p>The hammer has a solid wood handle that absorbs some of the strike impact, is very durable, and just plain looks good. The business end of the tool is drop-forged alloyed steel with a curved claw opposite the face for use in pulling nails back out of walls or other surfaces.</p><p>At under a pound in total weight, and measuring just 11.5 inches in length, the hammer won’t take up much room in your toolbox, nor will it weigh you down.</p><p>While tinner's hammers are mostly intended for shaping sheet metal and other metalwork, they are also useful for driving nails through tough wood or metal. The Estwing T3-18 will give you 18 ounces to play with when you want extra force and durability behind <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/safely-hammer-a-nail-4768035" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">your swing</a>.</p><p>Despite the size and weight, this hammer comes with shock reduction grip to minimize the amount of shock and vibration your wrists absorb after a strike. This type of design tries to keep the shock in the hammer, so your bones and ligaments don't take the brunt of the force. The hammer is properly weighted between the head and claw, which is forged directly with the handle as one piece for a well-balanced feel in your grip.</p><p>You’ll feel like Thor when you give the Estwing Sure Strike 3-Pound Drilling Hammer a swing. Drilling hammers, also called club hammers, are one step below sledgehammers in terms of power and weight, so this is a tool you’ll count on for the toughest tasks, such as driving chisels into brick, pounding nails into the hardest woods, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-to-make-your-demolition-job-go-fast-1822279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">demolition</a>, or driving stakes into wood, the ground, or other hard surfaces.</p><p>The double-faced hammer has a hardened, tempered steel head and an 11-inch heavy-duty fiberglass handle with a ribbed, easy-grip jacket that keeps the tool securely in your grasp even during the most powerful swing. Its total weight is 3.51 pounds, which is heavy, but not overly so for most people. It’s a great choice for anyone who needs a hammer for tough jobs around the house or yard.</p><p>Want a good hammer that is more versatile than just driving nails into wood? A good claw—the rear end that lets you remove things like nails and damaged screws—can be a useful addition for projects that require some deconstruction. The Craftsman 18-Ounce Flex Claw takes the traditional hammer claw to the next level by adding a solid pivot point for a degree of adjustability. Since you may find nails in surfaces at different, uncomfortable angles, an adjustable claw can move to provide you the best angle to pull a nail out.</p><p>The claw locks at four different positions, so you can quickly set the rear end to the desired angle as you work. For hammering, this tool also includes a large striking face and sufficient weight for a solid swing and impact with each stroke.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Hammer</h2><h3>Handle</h3><p>There are three basic materials used for hammer handles: wood, fiberglass, and steel.</p><p><strong>Wood </strong>is the classic hammer handle, and still preferred by many. It’s fairly lightweight, doesn’t transmit a lot of vibration to your hand and wrist, and with enough use, wooden handles tend to “form” a little bit to your hand over time. Still, wooden handles are the likeliest to break and they can be slippery. They’ll also rot or warp if left out in rough conditions or exposed to moisture. Generally, you can replace a wooden hammer handle if it breaks, however.</p><p><strong>Fiberglass </strong>handles are not as light as wood, but weigh less than steel. Fiberglass is also good at reducing vibration from hammer blows; this can be a major issue if you are using your hammer for a lengthy work session. Because fiberglass doesn’t conduct electricity, these hammers are a good choice if you’ll be working in an area with live wires. Nor will fiberglass rot or warp over time. On the downside, you won’t be able to replace the handle should it break. Typically, fiberglass handles have a rubber or composite grip to prevent the tool from slipping out of your hand.</p><p><strong>Steel </strong>hammer handles are the heaviest, but also the strongest, making them a favorite for demolition work. Steel transmits a great deal of vibration, however, which means you could end up with sore wrists and arms by the end of your work session. Steel hammers are generally one piece of forged metal from handle to head, unlike fiberglass and wooden hammers, giving them excellent durability. Typically, these hammers have a rubber or composite grip to help reduce some of the vibration and make it easier to keep a hold of the tool when your hands get sweaty.</p><h3>Type</h3><p>There are a lot of different types of hammers out there, each with a specific purpose, although there is a lot of overlap between many of them. Here are some of the most common types of hammer.</p><p><strong>Claw</strong>: This is the most common type of hammer. The head has a slightly curved, forked claw that’s useful for pulling nails out of wood and other materials, and a smooth face that won’t mar the wall as you drive the nail home.</p><p><strong>Framing</strong>: These hammers are very similar to claw hammers, but the claw is straight, rather than curved. Often, framing hammers have a slightly textured face that helps hold nails in place as they are struck.</p><p><strong>Ball Peen</strong>: The head of this hammer has a flat face on one side and a round, somewhat ball-shaped face on the other. There is no claw. Ball peen hammers are mostly used for metalwork.</p><p><strong>Club</strong>: Also called drilling hammers, these tools with two short, flat faces are basically smaller sledgehammers. Club hammers are great for light demolition, as well as driving chisels and wedges.</p><p><strong>Rubber Mallet</strong>: Shaped much like a club hammer, but with a rubber head instead of metal, mallets are not used to drive nails, but rather, to add some force when driving stakes or chisels, building furniture, working with upholstery, or similar tasks where you need more power than your hands provide alone, yet you don’t want to damage the surface upon which you are working.</p><p><strong>Tinner's</strong>: These hammers have a square face and a sharp claw without a fork. They are mostly used for metalwork, including hammering sheet metal and automotive repairs.</p><h3>Weight and Length</h3><p>A hammer that weighs too much will tire you out, but go too light and you sacrifice strike power. It should be noted here that a hammer’s weight refers to just the weight of the steel head, <strong>not</strong> the weight of the entire tool.</p><p>You’ll find claw hammers weighing as little as 8 ounces and monsters weighing as much as 32 ounces, but for the average DIYer, a tool that’s between 16 and 20 ounces is best. Go towards the bottom of that range if you’ll mostly use the hammer for hanging pictures and similar light tasks, and towards the upper end of the range if you’ll be doing framing or similar construction activities.</p><p>When it comes to length, longer isn’t always better. While it’s true that a longer hammer lets you build up more momentum for a more powerful blow, it’s also true that such a hammer weighs more than its shorter counterparts, and is generally not necessary for the average DIYer.</p><p>As a general rule, choose a claw hammer that’s between 12 and 16 inches in length for typical around-the-house repairs and tasks.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/michelle-ullman-350447" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Michelle Ullman</a>, the tool expert for The Spruce.

<description><![CDATA[Plant parents need high-quality pots for their indoor and outdoor foliage. We researched the best planters for all your potting needs.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-decorate-with-plants-4049334" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">decorate with plants</a>, whether you're placing them indoors or outdoors. When arranging them inside, a bit of greenery can add an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/decorating-with-greenery-4156594" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">organic appeal</a> and a beautiful pop of color. Houseplants can also <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-indoor-plants-for-clean-air-4177660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">purify the air</a> by removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are emitted from many household products. Cleaners and disinfectants, aerosol sprays, and paint are all common products that emit VOCs. Potted plants can also be placed outside to liven up your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/patio-landscaping-ideas-2132498" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">patio landscaping</a> or create an informal perimeter around your space.</p><p>No matter where you place your shrubs and flora, you'll first need a home for your foliage. Whether you're looking for something small or large, there are tons of options to choose from online.</p><p>If you're ready to start shopping, here are the best planters to spruce up your living space.</p><p>For an all-around high-quality planter with a versatile design, we recommend the Fox & Fern Fiberstone Plant Pot. It comes in four sizes, including options with 8, 10, 12, and 15-inch diameters, each between 8 to 15 inches tall.</p><p>Handmade from fiberstone (a blend of fiberglass and crushed stone) with a white or black finish, it's much lighter than ceramic but impressively durable and weatherproof. This simple, chic planter also has a drainage hole with a plug on the bottom. It can be placed on almost any plant saucer, but you might consider getting the brand's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fox-Fern-Mid-Century-Modern-Plant/dp/B07KCL2RJ3/?tag=thespruce-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Mid-Century Modern Stand</a> for a little extra height.</p><p>Looking for a budget-friendly option? The La Jolíe Muse Plant Pot looks like a high-end planter but with a more affordable price tag. Made from a mix of recycled plastic and natural stone powder, it has a lovely speckled appearance similar to terrazzo. Plus, it has four drain holes and can be used either indoors or outside.</p><p>If you're open to splurging on something truly grand, this bulbous planter from CB2 won't disappoint.

If you already have plants that need potting, you should have a decent idea of the size you need. But if you buy plants after the fact, you'll want to make sure they're the right size.</p><p>Keep in mind that as plants grow, they sometimes need to be transferred to bigger containers. Additionally, pots can look a lot larger online than they are in real life, so make sure you <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/before-you-buy-a-garden-planter-1402344" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">check the dimensions</a> before ordering.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>You'll also want to consider the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/all-about-choosing-plant-containers-847998" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">material</a>. Planters have traditionally been made of ceramic, whether it's glazed porcelain or unglazed terracotta. However, today's options can be constructed out of a number of substances, such as plastic, fiberstone, recycled materials, resin, cement, or metal. All of these materials can offer weather resistance and durability, but be sure to double-check the product description before placing your planter outside.</p><h3>Drainage</h3><p>Many planters have <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choosing-plants-for-garden-pots-847797" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">holes on the bottom</a> to allow for drainage and prevent overwatering. This isn't a requirement, but it can be helpful if you're a novice, as overwatering is one of the most common ways to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-i-prep-my-houseplants-for-winter-5082860" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">kill plants</a>. Hanging pots and wall planters don't typically have drain holes to avoid water dripping down your walls and onto your floors. Some larger planters don't have them either, as they're usually intended to be placed directly on the floor.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/theresa-holland-5095480" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Theresa Holland</a>, who is a seasoned commerce writer with several years of experience covering home and garden products.

We all bring unique aspects to where we live in terms of style and decor.</p><p>Our zodiac signs can give some insight as to what we value and how we decorate our homes. They can also shed some light on the unconventional aspects of our personalities and how they shine through in our spaces! Take a look at your zodiac sign below to see the most unique part of your home.</p><h2>Aries (March 21 to April 19): Fitness and Activities</h2><p>You’re someone who values standing out from the crowd and constantly moving. Your home may have many different unique aspects to it, but the one that really shines is the area of your home dedicated to fitness or activities.</p><p>While you certainly believe that entertaining guests should include a place to sit and dine, you think it’s equally important to set aside space for people to bond together through other means. Whether this looks like a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/home-gym-ideas-4156758" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">home gym</a> and games room, or something more intricate, it’s clear that staying active and having a good time is essential to you.</p><h2>Taurus (April 20 to May 20): Curated Luxury</h2><p>For a Taurus, the most unique part of your home relates to the luxurious, comfortable decor items you’ve purchased for yourself. You aren’t one to spend money on something unless you’re 100% sure it’s what you want, so you ensure the items are on display–and they are rarely things anyone else has.</p><p>An elegant clawfoot bathtub, a fully stocked wine cellar, or a handmade dining table made by a prestigious craftsman wouldn’t be out of place for you. You curate your home in such a specific way, and it shows.</p><h2>Gemini (May 21 to June 20): The Home Office</h2><p>Your home likely has many intriguing aspects to it, given your shifting interests and flexible personality. However, the most unique part of your home is your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/beautiful-home-office-ideas-4140701" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">home office</a>–which rarely looks like the standard.</p><p>You care about its aesthetics, of course, but you also care about its connectivity. A big part of working for you is networking and staying on top of what’s happening in the world, so you invest in smart home devices, have multiple computer monitors, and a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/home-library-design-ideas-4129190" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully stocked library</a> with books covering a range of topics. </p><h2>Cancer (June 21 to July 22): The Kitchen</h2><p>In most Cancer homes, there is typically one room that stands out from the others–the kitchen. However, what causes this room to draw others in is how you arrange and display everything.</p><p>You ensure plenty of seating, display your high-end kitchen tools on your counters, show off <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/plant-a-kitchen-herb-garden-1762222" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">an herb garden</a> for fresh ingredients, and add plenty of personal touches to make people feel at home. Your kitchen isn’t just where you cook, it’s where you connect and bond with others, and it shows. </p><h2>Leo (July 23 to August 22): Lighting</h2><p>Leo signs are known for being larger than life. You aren’t afraid of being the center of attention, and this can show up in various ways in your home. A unique aspect, however, is how you <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/the-hottest-lighting-trends-for-your-foyer-and-beyond-797848" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporate lighting</a> into your space.</p><p>Whether it’s using the natural light from your windows or investing in lamps and other light fixtures to keep the place glowing, you don’t want your home hiding in the shadows.</p><p>You also gravitate towards options that reflect light, such as oversized decorative mirrors or metallic accents. You want the place to always radiate light and energy, and you absolutely accomplish it!</p><h2>Virgo (August 23 to September 22): Organized Storage</h2><p>The most unique part of a Virgo’s home lies in how the space is organized and you have a reputation for being a perfectionistic. While Virgo design may lean towards minimalist tendencies, the way you keep clutter out of sight and everything in place isn’t always conventional.</p><p>By creating additional storage space in unused areas (think under-the-staircase-drawers or using the tops of cabinets as extra shelving) or building structures yourself with some DIY magic, you go above and beyond to create a home that functions precisely the way you want.</p><h2>Libra (September 23 to October 22): Hospitality</h2><p>The unique part of a Libra’s home is the intentional hospitality you pour into it. From <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-cut-flower-varieties-4152956" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">fresh-cut flowers</a>, lit candles, easy-going color schemes–your entire home is dedicated to leaving a personal impression on your guests.</p><p>You arrange the items in your rooms so they are symmetrical and give a sleek vibe. You go out of your way to entertain others, and you want to ensure anyone who comes into your home feels welcomed and belongs there.</p><h2>Scorpio (October 23 to November 21): Privacy Is Key</h2><p>Scorpio signs are known to keep certain aspects of their life private, and the way you go about it is often unique. This could be through hidden rooms that aren’t easily accessible or items that look like one thing but turn out to be another. Regardless, you have unconventional ways to keep your life hidden when need be.</p><p>You are likely to decorate your bedroom (or any room that you don’t typically allow others to see) with elegant and stunning decor because you feel you can be yourself in those spaces–and they usually look unlike what people expect from you. Your uniqueness is wrapped up in mystery, which is how you prefer it.</p><h2>Sagittarius (November 22 to December 21): Ever-Changing and Personal</h2><p>The most unique part of your home can change because your interests constantly evolve and expand. Whether you are off on an adventure or learning about new schools of thought, you rarely keep your home the same if you can help it.</p><p>Your home tells a story about your life–even if at times it may seem like a chaotic one! The way you decorate your rooms and the items you choose tend to hold value, meaning, and often have a specific tale behind them. You don’t pick decor or furniture simply for appearances, but, rather, because they say something specific about you.</p><h2>Capricorn (December 22 to January 19): Simple Touches</h2><p>The most unique part of a Capricorn’s home is how you do so much with so little. You don’t require much to be happy, even though you work hard to earn anything you get.</p><p>Your home is often associated with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-create-a-neutral-color-scheme-798012" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutral color schemes</a>, practical purchases, and a sleek atmosphere. However, you always find a way to make a statement—even through the smallest touches.</p><p>Whether it’s pops of color or more personal displays of what is important to you, your home is often a prepared backdrop that sets the stage for what matters to you.</p><h2>Aquarius (January 20 to February 18): Quirky Touches</h2><p>It may be difficult to pin down which part of an Aquarius’ home is the most unique, given your unconventional personality! You prefer to stay out-of-the-box with your home design, and it shows. When you have guests over, your house likely showcases multiple elements that they aren’t accustomed to seeing.</p><p>Whether it’s mismatched furniture that somehow still works well together, an unusual wall color that highlights your quirkiness, or an unusual bookshelf holding copies of your favorite non-mainstream books, your entire home typically radiates uniqueness–it’s hard to select only one section!</p><h2>Pisces (February 19 to March 20): Relaxation Items</h2><p>In a Pisces home, the unconventional is not only welcomed but wholeheartedly embraced! You have an intuitive knack for blending relaxation items with creative options that stand out from the crowd.</p><p>This can involve accentuating items associated with rest in unusual ways, like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-hammocks-to-buy-4144592" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hammock</a> on your porch, a hanging chair in your living room, or an oversized pouf that others can lay on.</p><p>It can also be reflected by the artistic items you come across, whether it’s a stunning piece by a local artist or a handmade vase you made yourself in a pottery class. You have a distinctive way of viewing the world, and your home is a perfect canvas for that!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 7 Best Stud Finders of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/UiQL1lmo6MqQZ1-NO1Z2QC2SHEI=/5760x3840/young-man-with-stud-finder-examining-wall-at-home-169267758-5a297cb5e258f800368eb3e1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[A good stud finder is a necessity when hanging pictures and mirrors. We tested the best stud finders to help you find a sturdy anchor for your nails and screws.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good stud finder can be the difference between a successful <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/home-repair-skill-levels-explained-4692307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY home project</a> and disaster. When hammering or screwing things into walls, ceilings, and floors, you need to know what is on the other side. That's why a stud finder is so crucial.</p><p>All stud finders do the same basic thing: detect where support areas like studs and joists are inside the walls. All stud finders can detect wood, most detect metal, and many also detect live electrical wiring. Some finders provide basic detection capabilities that are good for just walls. Others can be used on floors and ceilings.</p><p>To cover all of your potential needs, here are the best stud finders. </p><p>Above anything else, a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/stud-finders-need-to-know-1824804" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">stud finder</a> needs to be accurate. If you can’t trust the tool you are using to prevent utter disaster, there is no point in spending a dime on it. For a successful project, you need to know what you are dealing with on the other side of the wall. The electronic ProSensor 710 Franklin Sensors Precision takes the top spot because of the accurate and detailed look it will give you while in use; its 13 sensors simultaneously "look" behind the walls or underneath the floors, pinpointing the location of wooden studs and metal objects easily and accurately.</p><p>The Precision can scan a wide area of wall while searching for studs underneath. The extra width of the device means you will have a more accurate sense of stud locations as you move the finder along the surface. LED lights on the front will light up, marking the location and width of any stud so you will know exactly where the stud begins and ends as you work.</p><p>With the BLACK+DECKER BullsEye Line Laser with Stud Sensor, you get two tools in one. It’s the ideal assistant when you are hanging or mounting heavy items that need to be both securely fastened to a stud for support, and to be perfectly straight, such as cabinets, mirrors, heavy artwork, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/should-you-mount-your-tv-over-your-fireplace-4684916" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">televisions</a>, or shelves.</p><p>Use the device first to find hidden objects inside your wall, including studs, metal pipes, wood support beams, and live AC wires. The device works on drywall, lathe, plaster, and concrete walls. Just depress the power button—you’ll need to keep it depressed with your thumb or finger while you work—slide the device across the wall in your targeted work area, and you’ll hear a beep when the tool encounters a stud or other object inside the wall.</p><p>Once you’ve found the stud that you want to use to securely anchor your object, switch the BullsEye to its level function. There’s a small pin on the back of the device you can use to anchor it to the wall, if desired, while you work. On line function, the BullsEye beams a red laser line up to 20 feet horizontally in both directions, giving you plenty of assistance in properly aligning whatever it is you want to hang.</p><p>The BullsEye comes with two AA batteries, and is covered by a two-year limited warranty.</p><p>For the occasional weekend home project, there's no need to break the budget on a stud sensor. You still need to be careful, however, since many lower-priced options lack the accuracy you need to reliably drill into your walls without striking something you didn't expect to be there. Typically, the best budget options offer the basics without the extra detection capabilities. The Zircon StudSensor E50 will give you basic wood and metal stud detection at an affordable price, but doesn't lack in precision.</p><p>This finder packs a lot of handy features within its small price tag. Capable of detecting both wood and metal studs, the finder will flash and beep once it has picked up the edge of a stud. It includes two scanning modes: StudScan for studs up to 0.75 inches deep and DeepScan for targets around 1.5 inches deep. The finder also includes the ability to detect <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/common-types-of-electrical-wiring-1152855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">live AC wires</a> to avoid drilling into dangerous electrical hazards.</p><p>Metal is another support material that's often missed by typical stud finders calibrated for wood studs. Even magnetic finders might not register all types of metal, since many metals aren’t magnetic. The Zircon MetalliScanner M40, on the other hand, is custom designed to detect a wide variety of metal supports and objects behind floors, walls, and ceilings.</p><p>The MetalliScanner will detect both ferrous (magnetic) and non-ferrous metals behind most types of nonmetal walls, floors, and ceilings. Beyond metal studs and other support structures, this makes the finder great for locating smaller items like screws and nails deeply embedded into the wall up to four inches deep. The blue coil lights up as you move the finder to reveal the precise location of any object it detects, making it easy to pinpoint the location of hidden materials.</p><p>Magnetic stud finders are the old-school cousins of modern, more advanced electronic finders. Despite their simplicity, a good magnetic finder can be a great budget or additional option if you want something that will work without any batteries. Using a built-in magnet, stud finders like the CH Hanson 03040 will naturally be attracted to the nails and screws that hold the home’s frame together, giving you a good idea of where studs are <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/drywall-framing-guide-1821976" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">behind the wall</a>.</p><p>The finder uses powerful rare earth magnets to find metal studs and fasteners without any need for batteries. The body of the finder also includes a two-way level so you can hang the finder from a metal stud for accurately leveling walls and other surfaces. A pointed arrow on the bottom will conveniently mark the safe spot for screws and nails, eliminating the need for trial-and-error while hanging pictures, frames, and other objects onto the walls.</p><p>It’s important to have an accurate idea of the support behind the floors and ceilings if you have a project that requires drilling or hammering into these surfaces, such as hanging a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-install-a-ceiling-fan-4690727" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">ceiling fan</a>. You certainly don't want a large chunk of drywall crashing down onto the floor or the top of your head. The Bosch GMS120 is a multi-scanning option that is comfortable to hold in awkward positions, making overhead work safer and easier.</p><p>The ergonomic design of the finder houses a multi-mode sensor capable of detecting wood studs, metal support objects, and live AC wiring at the same time. This finder is the top choice for floors since it provides a deep 4.75-inch scan depth, and can handle materials as dense as cured concrete. The LCD display and audible detection signals also provide plenty of feedback for finding and noting objects underneath the floor surface.</p><p>One of the most dangerous things hidden inside walls and ceilings is live <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/top-electrical-wiring-tips-1152908" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrical wiring</a>. Wiring to the lights, outlets, and switches can kill if you are drilling or hammering into your walls with the power on. But even when the power is off, you can still avoid the headache of severing a wire with a finder that can detect the smaller profile of AC wires, such as the Folai Wall Scanner. If you want to play it safe with electrical wiring, this stud finder will give you extra peace of mind while working.</p><p>But detecting AC wires isn’t all this wall scanner is good for; the finder includes five different scanning modes for woods, metals, and AC wires hidden up to two inches behind the walls. Using the scanner is a breeze: the large LCD display indicates depth and direction of studs or other items inside the walls, and the device’s audible beeps let you know if you are moving closer or further away from the hidden object.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Stud Finder</h2><h3>Sensor Type</h3><p>There are two basic types of sensors used in stud finders: electronic and magnetic.</p><p>Electronic stud finders run on batteries. They work by detecting changes in the density of the surface being scanned. Typically, electronic stud finders have a visual display that pinpoints the location of the stud, and often have an audible signal as well. Electronic stud finders generally sense objects buried deeper inside the walls than magnetic stud sensors, but they also cost more.</p><p>Magnetic stud finders contain rare earth magnets that don’t actually detect wood inside the walls; instead, they detect the metal in the screws or nails holding the studs in place. These stud finders are fairly inexpensive, but won’t show you the exact edges of the stud, and don’t penetrate into the wall as deeply as their electronic counterparts.</p><h3>Depth Adjustment</h3><p>Some electronic stud finders let you adjust the depth to which the sensors penetrate into the wall. Typically, studs are buried around ¾-inch behind drywall, but there are times you want to go deeper to find other hidden objects, or you’re scanning floors for joists, rather than walls. Many stud finders with this feature can penetrate the surface up to 1.5 inches deep.</p><h3>Alternate Materials</h3><p>While all stud finders detect wood, there are other types of materials that might be hidden behind your walls, including plastic or metal pipes and AC wiring. Many of today’s electronic stud finders have modes for detecting these materials, which is very useful when you’re doing more than merely looking for a stud to support a heavy mirror or shelf.  </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do you use a stud finder?</h3><p>It’s not difficult to use a stud finder, but these simple tools can make the difference between a successful DIY project and one that goes drastically wrong. After all, nobody wants to hear the sound of that heavy shelf crashing to the ground during the night because it wasn’t anchored to the wall studs, but instead, screwed merely into the drywall. </p><ol><li>Start by turning the stud finder on and checking that the batteries are charged. Make sure the sensors on the bottom of the tool aren’t dusty or damaged.</li><li>Place the stud finder on the wall where you plan on hanging your shelf or other item, and slowly move the stud finder horizontally across the wall. </li><li>When the stud finder detects the edge of a stud, it will beep, flash, or use a combination of signals to alert you. Mark the edge of the stud with a small pencil mark. </li><li>Continue to move the stud finder slowly across the wall until you find the other edge of the stud. Mark that with a pencil as well. Some stud finders will automatically determine both edges of a stud for you.</li><li>Continue moving the stud sensor across the wall until you’ve found several studs. They are normally equally spaced 16 to 24 inches apart, so after locating and marking a few studs, check the spacing to ensure you’ve really found studs, not other materials behind the walls. </li><li>Once you’ve determined that you’ve found the studs, you can hang your shelf, television, or other heavy item without worry.</li></ol><h3>Can stud finders be wrong?</h3><p>It’s not uncommon for a stud finder to trigger an alert, and yet the hidden object behind the wall isn’t actually a stud, but is a pipe, bracket, or some other material. Many stud sensors differentiate between these various types of materials, but the tool is not infallible and it is possible to get false readings. That’s why it’s important to continue scanning the wall until you’ve located at least three studs; if the distance between each is equal, and is 16 to 24 inches, you can be confident that you’ve located studs, not some other building material.</p><h3>Do stud finders work through ceramic tile?</h3><p>If you are planning on installing grab bars in the bathroom, but have fully tiled walls, you might figure that you’ll use your stud sensor to locate the studs behind the tile. Unfortunately, while stud sensors have no problem in scanning through drywall and similar materials, very few of these tools owned by the average homeowner or DIYer can reliably work through ceramic tile. For that, you typically need a scanner that uses radar to “look” through the wall, and those are generally very expensive. However, some deep-sensor stud sensors with settings to locate metal are able to penetrate tile with fairly reliable accuracy, so it’s worth giving one a try if you are set on fastening something heavy to a tiled wall.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/michelle-ullman-350447" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Michelle Ullman</a>, the tool expert for The Spruce.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/aNH0ypX8tcyzWB-vYABILujND9A=/1500x1000/jungalowlivingroom-bb1c437cb5ca4ce9872880b334d97efd.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Justina Blakeney living room warm terra cotta walls, plants, and colorful rug, pillows, and wall art for Jungalow" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to decorating a space with texture and color, it’s safe to say that no one does it as masterfully as designer, artist, and author Justina Blakeney. In honor of the release of her latest book, <a href="https://www.jungalow.com/products/jungalow-decorate-wild-by-justina-blakeney" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Jungalow: Decorate Wild</a>, we spoke with the Target Home Style Expert and founder/creative director of Jungalow on five ways we can make our homes wild, too.</p><p>As Justina said, “Decorating wild is all about tapping into your unique style, without inhibitions!”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/hxsj24TwZgICD7DvmV9mdB7hG-k=/2791x3333/JungalowDecorateWildBookCoverHiRes-f59b1b8ac861451ca1e37e5e3ff4d644.jpg" alt="Jungalow Decorate Wild book cover with Justina Blakeney" width="2791" height="3333" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Start From Within</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/aNH0ypX8tcyzWB-vYABILujND9A=/1500x1000/jungalowlivingroom-bb1c437cb5ca4ce9872880b334d97efd.jpg" alt="Justina Blakeney living room warm terra cotta walls, plants, and colorful rug, pillows, and wall art for Jungalow" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re eager to get a little more wild in your decor, Justina says, “A good place to start is with yourself.” If this feels intimidating, don’t worry: Justina has lots of tips on how to tap into your wild side <em>and </em>your creative side.</p><p>“Start by doing some creative warm-up exercises, like journaling, doodling, or creating a mood board on Pinterest. Once you get into the practice of letting your thoughts flow freely without judgment, it helps quiet the critical voice that can stifle our creativity.” </p><p>From here, the inspiration and creativity should begin to flow! “You may start having ideas about how you want to use your space differently or painting a room a slightly different color. When those ideas come to you, meet them with welcoming arms and start experimenting. All of us have that creative spark inside of us, we just have to invite, nurture and cultivate it so it can shine bright!”</p><h2>Find Your Inspiration</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Pi4yNMU8NVX_LG3DUvRWMlhuHnk=/1500x1000/justinablakeneymasksandbasketgallery-07c42b2c72c94392b5683a3b9ff3c369.jpg" alt="Justina Blakeney colorful basket gallery, plus masks, statues, and dolls" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><p>Inspiration can’t be forced, but it can be coaxed. If you need help finding your source, Justina recommends starting with a place. </p><p>“Think about a place that inspired you when you were a child—whether it’s a physical one or a fictional one—or a place that you love now as an adult, and use that as your jumping-off point. Think about the colors, textures, shapes, patterns, and scents [from] your inspirational place, and incorporate those elements into your home."</p><h2>Find Your Light</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/DzHcc_OffatHOJLfT-ZWf3selTg=/1000x1500/kitchenshelfie-fa613dfd580a4eeb8380ee40aa92af5a.jpg" alt="open shelving in kitchen with plants, figurines, and vases" width="1000" height="1500" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to picking the best rooms for experimenting, Justina explained, “Rooms with abundant natural light are great because they will be the most dynamic throughout the day.”</p><p>A living room that might be perfect for a morning cup of coffee can be the ideal spot for a cozy movie night—and that’s all down to the light. “Paint color can look bright in the daylight and moody in the evening.”</p><p>Plus, a bright room makes for an ideal habitat for one of Justina’s favorite design accessories: plants! “Plants tend to do better when they are close to a natural light source, so placing them in a room with good light also changes up the energy of the room quite a bit.”</p><h2>Renters Can Go Wild, Too</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/248KTz4QYQBhUwpgs-Cib0jUMZU=/1840x2760/c01_013PhotoCredtJungalow-f9732783d9764388926f2c2b736d1f9e.jpg" alt="Removable wall paper from Justina Blakeney's Jungalow" width="1840" height="2760" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to decorating wild, one of the main things that often stands out is the wall color. But you don’t have to be a homeowner to make a statement.</p><p>“Removable wallpaper is a great way to make a big impact without losing your security deposit!” said Justina. “There are a lot of great removable wallpaper options out there now in beautiful colors and patterns (we even have some in <a href="https://www.jungalow.com/collections/wallpaper-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">our online shop</a> at Jungalow!).”</p><p>This suggestion also comes with a small warning. “Some renters may have textured walls which may not be wallpaper-friendly, so I’d suggest ordering a sample first to see if the paper you like is easily applied and removable with your walls.”</p><p>If you find the wallpaper option isn’t working, Justina has an even easier solution. “You can always go a little wild with plants! It’s amazing the impact plants can have on an environment. They are not just decorative objects, but they are also fellow living beings! They purify the air we breathe, they remind us to slow down and have or give a sip of water, and they literally add life to any space.”</p><h2>Aim for a Cohesive Look</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/BWYiMdD2xRZ_gxX-GDsBiaNIVcg=/1000x1500/Dabito4Jungaloplants-80115f8727d0439b8beb1bde997b5218.jpg" alt="wall of plants from Justina Blakeney and Jungalow" width="1000" height="1500" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Dabito</span></figcaption></figure><p><br/>Even if you’re excited to decorate wild, there are still a few rules to avoid creating a visual mess. One approach is by grouping similar objects together - either by color or type. For example, I have an indoor container garden collection and in the book, I share how different groupings can create a completely different look,” said Justina.</p><h2>Look to Nature</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/JMjwIPXDda7NMdhZHPgf_nGvSFU=/1000x1500/bluehexagontilebathroom-7f99e3f3c7b94365aba622f58aee51ac.jpg" alt="blue hexagon tile shower Justina Blakenly" width="1000" height="1500" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jungalow</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Another great tip I often use when I want a layered yet cohesive look is [to pick] a color palette that is inspired by nature. One of my favorite memories is from a family vacation we took in Lake Tahoe. The deep blues of the lake inspired me so much that I used that as inspiration for our primary bathroom, which has a lot of different kinds of tile and wallpaper, but all in the same palette, creating a soothing look.”</p><p>As Justina pointed out, decorating wild is about creating a space that means something to you. “If you have a place you love, think about the colors you associate with it and try working within that color palette to give your space a harmonious feel,” Justina said.</p><p>Above all else, decorating wild is about having fun and pushing the boundaries, so go for it.</p><p>“Give yourself permission to get creative," said Justina. "Break some design rules, and get a little wild!”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>6 Tips For Designing The Perfect Kid Bedroom</title>

<description><![CDATA[When designing the perfect kid bedroom, function, fun and fads all play their part. Read on for tips for creating the perfect space for kids of any age.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/hh4zAdVgwe-itOer-mcDujIzwPI=/1500x1000/ForbesMasters-Tartt-Nursery-HiRes_02-fd88ab3dfbd2472c8f58a8403a0a2e71.jpeg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Girls bedroom" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Forbes Masters</span></figcaption></figure><p>What does the ‘perfect kid bedroom’ really look like? If you would have asked me this question at age six, I would have emphatically told you bright colors and Lisa Frank-themed bedding. If you asked me the same question at age twelve, I’d have swapped all of the cartoons for quotes and pictures of my friends and plastered these to every open surface. At age eighteen, I honestly couldn’t care less about my home bedroom because I was building my home-away-from-home at my <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/moving-into-a-college-dorm-room-2436516" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">college dorm</a>. And now, as I navigate the bedroom journey as a mom, I’m realizing that my aversion to neon duct tape and anime posters is really only because of my age. </p><p>But what really does go into creating the ideal space for your children? From the colors on the walls to the choice of décor, here are some tips to designing the perfect kid bedroom.</p><h2>1. Get Their Input</h2><p>If you’re looking to make a space that’s comfortable, welcoming, and exciting for your kid(s), make sure to include them in the process<em>. </em>While I’m not necessarily advocating for having your child as the key decision-maker, there’s a special kind of ownership that’s built when they are able to weigh in on kid bedroom ideas, decisions, and even purchases. </p><p>Depending on your child’s age, they can share preferences about desks, themes, or even colors. If your children share a room, you can even incorporate ideas that balance each of their perspectives so there are pockets of the space that truly feel unique and individual.</p><h2>2. Incorporate Their Favorites (in Flexible Ways)</h2><p>If you think back to your earlier years, chances are, you had a preferred character from a movie, TV show, song, etc. Maybe this character changed every year (or month, or week…), but it was still something you felt passionately about—and the same goes for your child! </p><p>Easy and flexible ways to incorporate your child’s favorite character(s) is to get removable wall decals that can be peeled off when your child is no longer into that specific phase. You can purchase cheap themed <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-places-to-buy-kids-bedding-4584264" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">bedding and blankets</a>, or even use something like a chalkboard to draw designs that can be easily erased.</p><h2>3. Rely on Neutrals to Allow for Change</h2><p>Whether it’s deciding what to eat for breakfast or determining a favorite paint color, kids are notoriously indecisive—and that’s honestly okay. The things we loved when we were little have undoubtedly changed—many times. Recognizing and accepting this in our children is the first step. </p><p>However, when it comes to colors, it’s best to try to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-create-a-neutral-color-scheme-798012" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">opt for neutrals</a> as much as possible. This makes the change far easier (without taking away the fun).</p><p>For example, rather than painting all four walls of your daughter’s bedroom bright blue, create an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choose-an-accent-wall-and-color-for-bedroom-350457" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">accent wall</a>. This wall will be a lot easier to change and won’t require as much time, money, and effort as painting the whole room again when she decides blue is no longer her favorite shade. </p><h2>4. Ensure the Space Is Conducive to Rest</h2><p>One key thing parents often overlook is that bedrooms are ultimately made for resting. Simple things can make a big difference. For example, it’s best to purchase a curtain that is floor-to-ceiling or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-blackout-curtains-4152964" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">blackout</a> to completely keep out the light. This will help with sleeping routines (especially for younger children), and most curtains come in fun colors so your child will still be able to express themselves. </p><h2>5. Create Different Areas for Different Activities</h2><p>At first glance, this tip may seem to relate to younger kids, but it’s actually relevant for all ages. Having different ‘pockets’ of the bedroom for different activities can help with autonomy, self-directed work and play, and accountability.</p><p>For example, creating a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/perfect-study-environment-for-your-child-2504846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">homework station</a> or workspace can help older children be more responsible and focused on their schoolwork or projects. For younger kids, having a ‘Legos’ station can help create more solid routines around bed or naptime because toys aren’t a part of the sleeping area. </p><p>As you’re designing the perfect kid bedroom, keep in mind that separation can also make the space look and feel bigger, which will make more room for fun.</p><h2>6. Consider Your Child’s Personality & Behavior</h2><p>When it comes to creating the perfect kid bedroom, some key things to keep in mind are your child’s temperament, personality, and behavior. In other words, if you have a child who is easily overstimulated by their environment, it’s best to incorporate colors and tones that are subdued. That way, the space feels comforting and safe. It may be helpful to add sensory objects, calm blankets, or other items that evoke joy and peace. </p><p>On the other hand, if you have a more energetic or even rambunctious child, you may want to consider a kid full-size bedroom set that has different layers, levels, or even incorporates movement with a ladder or slide. Something like this can create an opportunity for play and self-regulation, as opposed to a regular bed that will stifle your child’s natural energy and vigor. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<description><![CDATA[What should the zodiac sign Cancer know before decorating their home? Check out these 10 tips before you get started!]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/D8JtX7DcpSG7bCzuwQwddhYvyJE=/5760x3840/DesignbyEmilyHendersonDesignPhotographerbyTessaNeustadt_257-2f39afe9c21a4acf9aba2ccd95eae38f.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Blue and neutral palette in a living room" width="5760" height="3840" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Style by Emily Henderson</span></figcaption></figure><p>Decorating your home can be an exciting experience and is considered one of the most fun parts of living in your own space. It can also be a bit daunting, especially if you aren't sure where to start. Understanding more about your zodiac sign can help you work out the type of direction that will suit you.</p><p>Cancer signs are known as nurturing and down-to-earth and have an immense love of their home. Ruled by the moon and often looked at as a "mothering" figure, your content being in the presence of your loved ones, which means you spend a great deal of time at home.</p><p>Before you get started, check out these ten things that every Cancer needs to keep in mind before decorating their home.</p><h2>Embrace Your Sentimental Side </h2><p>You're a nurturing and sentimental soul, so why not showcase it in your decor? Rather than buying decorations from Target, you can be a little more creative.</p><p>Design a wall of photographs of your loved one, display decor items others have purchased for you, or go the DIY route. You genuinely believe a personal touch brings things together, and it will make all the difference in your home.</p><h2>Give Your Home a Silver Lining</h2><p>Every zodiac sign has a power color, and for Cancers, it's silver! Given that you're ruled by the moon, it makes sense that this luminescent hue brings out your best qualities.</p><p>Try adding in silver through <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/metallic-wall-finishes-1821791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">metallic accents</a>, shimmering decor, or even some silver removable wallpaper to spruce up an area. However you use it, silver adds some elegance without trying too hard. With its ability to pair well with other shades, you can easily find a way to make it part of your decor.</p><h2>Don't Forget Your Personal Spaces</h2><p>Cancers are known to be fantastic hosts, and you are always prepared to go out of your way to ensure others are taken care of. Often this means places like your living room, your kitchen, or even <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/inviting-guest-bathroom-4147411" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">guest bathrooms</a> look stunning and are the focus.</p><p>However, don't neglect spaces that are private, like your bedroom or your office. Just because others won't see much of it doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in those rooms. Choosing to decorate with things you love will create a massive shift in your mood—and you deserve to take care of yourself, too.</p><h2>Comfort is Key</h2><p>Your home is the place you spend most of your time, so ensuring it's comfortable is essential! You value security and feeling grounded, so investing in soft blankets and comfy pillows is a great option.</p><p>You may feel that to create a stylish room you need to sacrifice comfort for style–yet with so many options to choose from these days, you don't need to! A <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/introducing-the-spruce-area-rugs-5115518" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">soft rug</a> under your bare feet, linen curtains that give a soft texture, and a couch that you can sink into after a long day are ideal.</p><h2>Create Boundaries in Your Home </h2><p>Although you enjoy comfort, you also benefit from boundaries and structure. While it can be easy to allow each room to be used for a mixture of purposes, create separate places for work, relaxation, and entertaining. It will not only give direction on how to decorate but will let each room shine!</p><h2>Don't be Afraid to Relax</h2><p>Life can be exceptionally stressful, especially for Cancers who are always trying to balance other's needs with their own. Your home is a haven from the outside world, so creating a calming atmosphere will benefit you.</p><p>You can make the space relaxing by mixing soft textures, using candles, or introducing other forms of soft lighting. Working with calming colors such as a light blue or even white can really set the tone. </p><h2>Incorporate Older Styles</h2><p>You're a bit of an old soul and drawn to items that have a history to them. You don't have to abandon all modern touches, but there is a way to go old-school that is classic rather than outdated.</p><p>Purchasing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-buy-vintage-furniture-1391351" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">furniture with an antique touch</a> or incorporating traditional styles into your home will allow your decor to feel timeless. Just be sure you don't overdo it–you can have too much of a good thing in this case!</p><h2>Invest in Your Kitchen</h2><p>Cancer signs are often associated with the kitchen—whether due to a love of cooking or the joy of gathering your loved ones together over a meal for connection. You are intentional about the foods you make and the various items you use to create well-thought-out meals. With this in mind, don't be afraid to invest more when it comes to decorating your kitchen.</p><p>Choosing nice serving dishes you can proudly display or purchasing a lovely table for your guests to gather around are ideal ways to allow your kitchen to stand out. </p><h2>Thrifting is Your Friend, but You Can Splurge Sometimes</h2><p>In your opinion, most things can be reused in some shape or form, and you take full advantage of that! You don't need to buy brand new items to decorate your space, which is why <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/dos-and-donts-for-thrift-store-shoppers-1313705" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrift shopping</a> is an excellent way to find decor for your home.</p><p>However, it's perfectly okay to splurge on some items on occasion, such as a comfortable bed that will last you years or a hand-crafted dining room table. You are allowed to treat yourself, especially when it involves the place you will spend most of your time.</p><h2>Clear Out The Clutter</h2><p>You know you have a habit of hanging on to old items you don't need. While some memories are certainly worth holding onto, take inventory of what matters and get rid of the things you don't need anymore. You'll likely be surprised at the number of items you've accumulated over the years!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Taking its name from “kinder,” the German word for children, the design style is seen by some as being too childish, too bold, or simply too limiting. We spoke with interior designers and home experts who expanded upon why exactly they’re not going to be falling head over heels for this colorful aesthetic anytime soon. </p><h2><strong></strong>It’s Not for All Ages</h2><p><a href="https://trendey.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Trendey</a> designer Andra DelMonico feels that the Kindercore aesthetic is limiting, in addition to being “juvenile and clunky.”</p><p>“The bold primary colors turn your home into a place that looks more like a preschool than an adult’s home," she said via email. While we do love featuring happy hues, it’s easy to see how the specific combination of so many bright shades can be a bit too kid-like. And for apartment dwellers, the look may be even more of a no-no. “The bubbly and overly rounded furniture takes up a lot of physical and visual space that doesn’t work well in smaller spaces,” DelMonico added. “The furniture can feel heavy, which can make the entire room feel weighted.” </p><h2>It Will Soon Look Dated </h2><p>Several of the designers we spoke with consider Kindercore to be just another trend rather than a lasting, timeless style. “While Kindercore is certainly playful, we feel that it will have a ‘now’ moment and then look incredibly dated, much like its aesthetic predecessor, Memphis,” Anne Mueller, principal at Boston’s <a href="https://www.briar-design.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Briar Design</a>, said in an email. Thus, she urges anyone longing to introduce the look to their home to do so using inexpensive pieces rather than making any investment purchases. She added, “Just like fast fashion has defined looks multiple times a year, many of the same retailers also offer home goods which are economically easy fixes to get in on the trend.” </p><p>That said, will it be possible to embrace Kindercore for good if one is so inclined? Potentially, according to Mueller. “The root of Kindercore features bold shapes and primary colors; a little can go a long way,” she explained. “It would be interesting to explore incorporating a few smaller elements in the right color palette into a room with antiques, as balancing the strong post-modern shapes and colors with more traditional elements can create spaces that are a bit more nuanced, and in turn, seem less trendy in the long haul.” </p><h2>It Isn’t as Adaptable </h2><p>There are some design styles or color schemes that are flattering in a wide range of spaces—brass pieces, for example, shine in modern and traditional spaces alike. However, Kindercore isn’t going to be as versatile due to its emphasis on primary colors. “I definitely prefer a more streamlined aesthetic—but not stark—rather, infused with warmth, texture, and sophisticated palettes that red, yellow and blue just don’t fit in,” Providence, Rhode Island designer <a href="https://www.ktid.net/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Kelly Taylor</a> said in an email. </p><h2><strong></strong>It’s Too Loud</h2><p>In a similar vein, the Kindercore look just isn’t a fit for those seeking to turn their home into a soothing sanctuary. “Primary colors are difficult to translate into a calming design scheme and most of our clients request a peaceful vibe in their home,” Los Angeles designer <a href="https://randeleamaninteriors.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Rande Leaman</a> said in an email, describing Kindercore as “a hard sell for most clients.”</p><p>Phillip Ash, the founder of <a href="https://propaintcorner.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Pro Paint Corner</a>, calls primary colors “uninspired.” He wrote in an email, “I favor tones that have more depth to them, so the bright, one note feeling that primary colors give off fails to inspire me.” </p><p>In fact, Kindercore elements may negatively influence one’s day-to-day well-being, according to <a href="https://cabinetselect.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Cabinet Select</a> co-founder and certified building contractor Chris Alexakis. “Over time, the colors around us can affect our mood and emotional states in subtle ways,” he explained in an email. “What seems fun and vivid at first can gradually turn into a stress-inducing environment.” </p><p>In particular, Alexakis advises abstaining from featuring Kindercore design in a work space and suggests using soft blues or grays instead. “Those colors can calm your nerves or promote productivity,” he wrote. “For some people, being immersed in a Kindercore aesthetic can cause headaches or eye strain.” </p><h2>Best Use for Kindercore Design</h2><p>So when<em> can </em>one implement the Kindercore design scheme? It’s best used in spaces occupied by little ones, according to Leaman, She added, “The kindercore aesthetic is childlike and playful but not exactly restful! Best to leave this style to a children’s bedroom or playroom, where it can be fully appreciated.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, that's right. Girls are powerful and so are these women, especially when it comes to creating beautiful and useful pieces from wood, metal, and more. These girls are kicking butt in an historically male-dominated industry, and we cannot get enough! Here we find out how they got started and how you can, too.</em></p><h2>About Jen Woodhouse</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/86wkvBAEX7tkmwv1ff1iheXm7-k=/2411x3616/hi-res-headshot-e7ca3fcacb9f4b9f9d7eae78f45a38b8.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse portrait for Girls Who Build" width="2411" height="3616" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What:</strong> Self-taught carpenter, woodworker, and DIY guru<br/><strong>Where: </strong><a href="https://jenwoodhouse.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenwoodhouse/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_xpuqcx32HL0s03B_sANA" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jenwoodhouse/_created/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4">Pinterest</a>, currently based in Central Kentucky<br/><strong>Why: </strong>“If you can follow a recipe, you can build a table.”<strong> </strong><br/><strong>How: </strong>“Once you get started, you’ll realize it’s not as hard as you expected. Then, before you know it, you have a coffee table that <em>you</em> built!”</p><p>When it comes to mainstays of the virtual woodworking world, self-taught carpenter Jen Woodhouse is one of the greats. Regularly cited as a source of inspiration for the women featured in our <em>Girls Who Build </em>series, we were thrilled to catch Jen for a Zoom interview, talking all things woodworking, home improvement, and DIY.</p><p>After being stationed in Central Kentucky for the past 18 months for her husband’s military job, Jen is currently feeling very much at home. Growing up with a dad in the Air Force, she’s no stranger to moving often, but this is the first home they’ve bought—and, as she talked about her day-to-day life, she leaned out of the frame to show off the wooden floors they recently laid.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/GxoXcfKJVaqOBYYwW0eA2sUTXew=/900x600/stacked-slat-side-table-5-290dbd34bcac4276bc7a5e199103ac5b.jpg" alt="Stacked Side Table with Jen in an armchair nearby" width="900" height="600" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><h2>The Search for a Shoe Storage Solution Started the Journey</h2><p>But even though this is their first time as homeowners, it was the desire to improve her living space that first introduced Jen to woodworking. Back in 2010, while living in Fort Lee, Va., she and her husband were newlyweds on a budget. Jen longed to make their tiny apartment feel like home, and in an effort to reorganize their entryway, she started to search for a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ultimate-guide-boot-and-shoe-storage-4070014" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">shoe storage solution</a>. Her search returned no viable options to buy, but she eventually found plans to make one.</p><p>“I’d never built anything. I didn’t even have tools, so my husband was like, ‘you want to do what?’”</p><p>Even though she didn’t grow up in a family of builders, Jen knew she could do it. “My dad is the type of person who would hire someone to change a ceiling light,” she said with a laugh. But she's always found fulfillment in making things and was regularly looking for a creative outlet. </p><p>So, armed with the plans she found online, Jen and her husband went to Home Depot, where she picked out all the lumber. Then, she made the rookie mistake of asking them to cut each piece for her. She learned on the spot that they normally only do this to fit the material into your car, but she laid out the plans and asked for specific cuts. Back home, with only a power drill and a sander, she assembled the pieces according to the plan. Shocked to have a completed shoe caddy, she turned to her husband once again.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Let’s go to Home Depot and get some tools!’ And it just grew from there.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/1HeGDmDQY6iHaRGEY2PpXmxSDKY=/900x600/modern-sliding-door-entertainment-center-2-f20d7c7783b94ec9acbf1dcf0c57f270.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse with Miter saw cutting wood in workshop" width="900" height="600" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><h2>From Sharing Experiences to Sharing Expertise</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Uv7xWc3iUNNl6lPdGI4zV_LUGqU=/3633x5450/Jen-Woodhouse-acrylic-calendar-ca70df9567044aae8b8cdf8b3aa57f78.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse's DIY acrylic calendar mounted on a wall over a desk with computer and chair" width="3633" height="5450" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><p>After their daughter Evie was born, her husband knew exactly how to celebrate. For her first Mother’s Day, he gifted Jen with a compound miter saw, “and I’ve been building ever since!”</p><p>It wasn’t long before her work as a builder merged with her life as a content creator. She originally posted DIY content, like refinishing furniture that she found, including sanding or staining, or wrapping a headboard in fabric. But once she was confident enough, she started to share the things she built by hand.</p><p>“I started out documenting my projects. [It] was less about teaching other people and more about what I did and what mistakes I made. But then it grew from sharing my experience to sharing my expertise.”</p><h2>Her Beginner Tutorials Follow Recipe-Like Simplicity</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/sWAUkd28xpdHjP50xDWXbBJLGEw=/3909x5863/DIY-Giant-Scrabble-8a6930b1a5d845f79f31447df1d8a938.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse poses next to her DIY giant Scrabble board mounted on a wall" width="3909" height="5863" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><p>Today, Jen is on a constant mission to make building more accessible. She writes all of her own furniture plans, and she keeps that newlywed shoe caddy in mind every step of the way. “Taking the intimidation out of it was my goal.”</p><p>That's why Jen’s plans read like recipes—she lists what you need, where to buy your ingredients (i.e. materials), and which tools you should use. “If you can follow a recipe, you can build a table,” Jen assured us.</p><p>“The plans that I write and the tutorials that I create are geared toward beginners, so you only need three tools—a saw, a drill, and [either] a sander or a pocket hole jig. Nothing fancy, just three really basic tools and you can get started building your furniture with very limited resources.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/nnamExR_xR7JCorgtZyDf83s_v0=/900x1350/DIY-entertainment-center03-c837e60d0b8b40f29bed472c3918f048.jpg" alt="DIY Home Entertainment system" width="900" height="1350" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Diving Into Home Improvements</h2><p>Now, Jen looks back and understands that her passion for building was also rooted in necessity. “Because we’re a military family, we’re moving around every two years. So it’s always a different thing—a different house to fill, a different need.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Le5382NUp3P1_hkoEGRZUEkCt98=/900x600/How-to-remove-tile-the-easy-way-2-9d2eac09d5b74373ba6b3468037531c6.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse remove floor tiles the easy way" width="900" height="600" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><p>But now that they've settled in a bit more than in the past, she’s been looking at new sources of inspiration, shifting her focus more and more to home improvement projects. She rattled off her current projects, which included renovating a bathroom, tiling for the first time, knocking down walls, and figuring out how to lay flooring. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/LEl2EfzJTZXBpPYVzD5fNnr2SNk=/3016x2011/Built-In-Bunk-Beds-1ae22e6db0e54b42b756e96483141173.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse poses with her two children next to the built-in bunkbeds she created" width="3016" height="2011" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><p>And amidst the home improvement projects, Jen is also happy to play to her audience more, creating plans for the projects she knows her readers want to see. “Kids projects are always really popular, like playhouses, as well as my kids’ beds,” she said. “But so are dining tables and coffee tables, because they’re very beginner-friendly.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/buZYQF_lSNp_aFk1eEBgp5IUoJk=/2048x1536/house-bed-with-storage-29-86958bf99cf84d8f890305859cd52ac8.jpg" alt="DIY kids bed with storage" width="2048" height="1536" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Lifting the Community That Inspires Her</h2><p>While her initial audience was comprised of people seeking out tutorials, it’s now become more about building a community. Over the past 10 years as a blogger, Jen is proud to have connected with so many other makers and online creators that share her space.</p><p>“People are doing really inspirational things and there so many new ideas being shared. It’s been really fun to see this community grow and be a part of pioneering the whole movement.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/8Q4loM04vVLizov2nERopfcUKlQ=/5325x3550/Jen-Woodhouse-playhouse-6c2098473a764c6bb928af5f62427c0c.jpg" alt="Jen Woodhouse's custom backyard playhouse" width="5325" height="3550" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Even Now, Trial and Error Is Important</h2><p>But while Jen might be a leader in the virtual building community, she’s not infallible in the workshop. In fact, she sees the value of trial and error.</p><p>“One of my favorite parts of this whole building and making process is the problem solving,” she said. “As I think about the project or come up with the concept, then design it, then draw up the plan, then execute the plan... I see ‘oh well that didn’t work, let me try this way instead.' That whole problem-solving aspect is one of my favorite things. Some of my plans go through 30 revisions. I always say, ‘I make all the mistakes for you!’”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/i1kPQGLJVaPLjSIrZMpK0S8LJGM=/1000x563/diy-built-in-cabinets-6-1637464c9c8146b1b83808faed73fc0b.jpg" alt="DIY built in cabinet construction" width="1000" height="563" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Jen Woodhouse</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Jen's Advice for Aspiring DIYers</h2><p>When it comes to getting started, Jen assured us that the best approach is to just dive in. “Just start. To me, that’s the most intimidating part, just starting. But once you get started you realize that productivity and action are what creates motivation.” </p><p>And as for how to get started: “I am a graduate of YouTube University and Google University!” Jen said proudly. With a full appreciation of the importance of research, Jen regularly turns to the internet for answers. Plus, there are people within her virtual world who inspire her with their innovation and how they grow the community, too.</p><p>“Our community is pretty tight and always uplifting,” she said, smiling. “Now I want to continue to grow; not just in my skills, but also in online content creation. This landscape is always changing. My hope is to continue growing and learning while inspiring and empowering others.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>5 Reasons Why Painted Arches Drive These Designers Up the Wall</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/skQG-uUUOm2TzPpEbPZWz1tF0wo=/1010x721/Accent_Wall-612e48dbb03c41bda6c348ac1c01e5a0-0130f6f28c584926a5dd0989c969143f.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[Four design experts weigh in on why they’d encourage you to resist the urge to paint an arch on your wall.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/skQG-uUUOm2TzPpEbPZWz1tF0wo=/1010x721/Accent_Wall-612e48dbb03c41bda6c348ac1c01e5a0-0130f6f28c584926a5dd0989c969143f.jpeg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="yellow painted arch in an office" width="1010" height="721" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">@grillodesigns / Instagram</span></figcaption></figure><p>Painted arches are one of Instagram’s favorite decor trends of the moment--these days, it’s hard to scroll through your feed without coming across a wall--or several--featuring a bright and bold hue. While arch pics may garner plenty of likes and comments, not all designers are on board with this artsy look. Here, four pros weigh in on why they’d encourage you to put down the paint brush. </p><h2>1. Arches Probably Won’t Stand the Test of Time </h2><p>They’re extremely current—to a fault. </p><p>Painted arches are trendy—and trends come and go, so who’s to say that this look will still be popular in another six months? “As cute and economical as [arches] are, they are also distinctly 2021,” says Michelle Nelson, a podcaster and blogger at <a href="https://www.byhyu.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Build Your House Yourself University</a>. “The painted arch will likely be one of those infamous design elements that is so strongly associated with a moment in time that including one in your home will significantly date your space once the trend has passed.” Remember the shag carpet of the 1970s? Likewise, “painted arches will, at some point, fall out of favor in home design,” Nelson adds. </p><p>In a similar vein, “interior trends will always come and go just as quickly as fashion ones, and a prime example of this is a painted arch,” design blogger and author <a href="https://www.instagram.com/citychicdecor/?hl=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Chelsey Brown</a> notes. “It’s the same as the zig-zag paint trend that was popular a few years ago.” Alternatively, Brown urges individuals to “just do what feels right to you in your home.” She says, “This allows your space to never feel outdated.” </p><h2>2. You’ll Always Have to Decorate Around Them</h2><p>No more spontaneous late night rearranging. </p><p>Love shuffling your furniture around frequently? You may be better off skipping an arch, designer <a href="https://www.adnananwardesign.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Adnan Anwar</a> advises. “Painted arches reduce your flexibility to shake up the layout of a room, which is something I always find myself doing in my own home,” he says. “As your life evolves and your needs from a room change, or you find something awesome, you don’t want to have to repaint your walls.” </p><p>Brown prefers using white walls as a blank canvas to display pieces such as artwork, shelves, or decor. “These are items that you can easily swap out in a breeze when you’re feeling like a refresh,” she explains. “A painted arch? That takes time to apply and even more time to cover up when the trend is over with. There are so many more ways to incorporate the colors you love into your home, and especially on your walls!” </p><h2>3. They May Disrupt a Room’s Flow</h2><p>This may be the case in terms of shape, color, and position. </p><p>“I’ve been dying for the painted arches trend to end since it began,” Anwar adds. “They usually  clash with the architectural lines of the rooms they’re in, specifically the rectangular windows and doorways.” Plus, the color featured may not successfully complement other elements in a room. Anwar adds, “I try to never put anything in a room that is totally out of context. If I use a shape or a color, I want it to have a buddy or two to give it context. And the painted arches I’ve seen never have that.” </p><h2>4. Arches May Make a Room Feel Smaller and Ceilings Seem Lower</h2><p>So they’re extra key to avoid if you already lack square footage. </p><p>For designer <a href="https://www.tracymorrisdesign.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Tracy Morris</a>, painted arches are “like a body piercing. It may seem like a beautiful or good idea at the time, but as life moves on, you will want to remove it in the end.” She adds that specifically, arch designs may “chop up the room” and make a space feel smaller, which generally isn’t ideal. Such arches may also make ceilings feel lower, Anwar adds, citing that they “make for awkward art placement,” which is another important factor to consider. </p><h2>5. They’re Not Easy to Paint Over </h2><p>Sure, technically you can cover an arch prior to move-out or if you just find yourself tiring of it, but repainting a wall isn’t a foolproof process. “If in the future the arch needs to be painted over, the area painted as the arch could be noticeable by the color poking through, or the thickness of paint in one particular spot,” explains Savannah Phillips, interior designer for <a href="https://www.knobs.co/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">The Knobs Company</a>. “While the painted arch may look cute in the moment, it is not an extremely functional trend.” </p><h2>If You Still Want It…</h2><p>If you just can’t pass up adding a painted arch to your abode, you’ll want to carefully consider factors such as paint color and location before getting started on your DIY, taking in the pros’ comments from above. You’ll also want to weigh your behaviors when it comes to redecorating--will you be ok positioning all of your belongings in relation to the arch for the time being, or will it disrupt you from having the freedom to move pieces around as your heart desires? Doing some careful thinking ahead of time will save you money and effort down the line. </p>]]></content:encoded>

And if you're lucky you can find something that is all of the above.</p><p>To help you get started, here are the best wedding gifts.</p><p>Whether the couple loves <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ideas-entertaining-outdoors-on-a-budget-2736349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">outdoor entertaining</a> on a regular basis or just appreciates a quiet night in, here’s a stylish and personalized way to keep wine, champagne, and more on chill. The bowl comes in a silver or gold finish and has a beautifully designed base. Add a touch of personalization with a monogram or their last name (up to 12 characters). </p><p>Now that the stress of wedding planning is behind them, give the lucky couple a reason to take a load off. Robes make a great wedding gift for almost anyone, and you can't beat the quality of the Parachute Home Robe. This unisex robe is made from 100% long-staple Turkish cotton and comes in either white or gray. Each robe works for any gender, with sizes ranging from small to extra-large. The Parachute robe is a favorite for its ultra-plush quality that (importantly) won't cling after a shower. It has two front pockets, a waist tie, and a shawl collar.</p><p>Looking for a gift that keeps on giving? The Best of “Mouth” Monthly Subscription Club is a unique wedding gift that the couple can receive again and again. You can prepay either three months, six months, or 12 months in advance, and each shipment includes four to five curated artisanal food products. With products ranging from cocktail mixes to chocolate bars to pickles, the Mouth subscription box has something for everyone - each item handpicked by Mouth staff.</p><p>For a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/personalize-your-wedding-vows-3490166" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">personalized gift</a> to truly make a couple feel special, Artifact Uprising’s photo book is a winner. Start with as few as 40 pages or work your way up to 200-plus and upload your favorite pictures of the couple. Choose between one of six book sizes and the fabric color of the cover. This special book is one the couple’s sure to revisit on special occasions or have permanently displayed on their coffee table.</p><p>Couples no doubt have mementos from the big wedding day that they just haven’t organized yet, so this is one way to do so. The foldable box comes with a series of labels, files, and small pullout boxes to store a boutonniere, invitations, cake topper, and more of the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/get-rid-of-sentimental-clutter-4126430" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">sentimental clutter</a>. This cloth-covered case is a stylish way to neatly organize those wedding day keepsakes they can’t bear to part with.</p><p>Married life means sharing TV shows, dinners at home—and yes, chores. Help make the first year of marriage a little easier with the iRobot Roomba 690 Robot Vacuum. This high-performance vacuum loosens dirt, lifts, and suctions without ever needing to lift a finger. Sensors help control the Roomba, allowing it to focus on dirt-heavy areas in the home. It also works with Amazon Alexa or via a phone app, so it can be programmed and controlled from afar. When this little robot is done cleaning, it tucks away into a wall dock until the next time it goes to work. It also transitions from carpet to hardwood seamlessly and is perfect for pet owners and parents alike.</p><p>Here's the perfect gift for the couple that brought their dogs to their wedding. Any animal lover will adore the Furbo Dog Camera, a device that allows a pet owner to see, hear, and reward their fur baby even when they're far away. This Wi-Fi-enabled HD dog camera has night vision and a powerful 160° wide-angle lens so that they can zoom in and see their pet from every corner. But the main attraction of the Furbo is its ability to hold up to 100 treats that can be tossed using an iOS or Android-enabled phone. It sends a notification when the dog barks, and even takes pup selfies when the dog is interacting with the camera.</p><p>The Braumbirdy Serif Date Memento is a piece of artwork that will commemorate their big day. Large, graphic letters depict the day they said “I do” in a modern, trendy style on your choice of high-end paper. You can choose between six color combos ranging from black and white to maroon to gray and in any size ranging from 5 x 7 to a whopping 44 x 60 inches. It comes either unframed or framed, with UV-plexi or standard plexiglass and a choice of various materials like reclaimed wood, copper, or chic-looking metal. Everything about the Seif Date is customizable, so you can create a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/make-unique-gift-baskets-1907849" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">unique gift</a> just for the couple.</p><p>For nights when a spread of meat and cheese is on the menu, this bamboo charcuterie board will be put to good use. The tiered tray is the perfect way to display light bites. Though it’s 18 inches wide, it actually folds to a compact nine inches when not in use, making it a great choice if kitchen space is limited. Also, the bottom features a hidden drawer with three cheese tools.</p><p>Any relationship can come with its challenging moments and couples will surely appreciate Core’s meditation trainer to keep them focused on a daily basis or when times get hard. The handheld device connects to an app and during <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/meditation-spaces-that-inspire-4177495" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">meditations</a>, sends light vibrations to help guide breathing and focus. The device can also measure stress and the app provides access to not just meditations, but also relaxing soundscapes.</p><p>Whipping up a cocktail is quick and easy with Bartesian. Just pop in one of the capsules (margarita, cosmopolitan, gin martini, etc.), add alcohol, and in seconds, it produces a perfectly mixed drink. The capsules, which were created by mixologists, removes the need to know a drink’s ingredients or have a range of mixers on hand. This is a fun gadget to whip out during a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-host-a-flawless-cocktail-party-1196838" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">cocktail party</a> or for a night of popcorn and movies.</p><p>For a truly sentimental gift, try this Wishing Ball from Uncommon Goods. The handblown glass is pretty small, just 4 x 3.5 inches, but it can truly pack a punch and show you care. The gift comes with 52 small sheets of paper and the couple can write down any hopes, wishes, or simply what they’re grateful for. This can be a weekly mindfulness activity to truly make couples focus on and visualize their future.</p><p>When gifting this unique piece, make sure couples understand this is designed as decorative and for empty <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/wine-etiquette-1216991" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">wine bottles</a>. The rack is made from reclaimed wood and will look great as wall decor for the kitchen, dining room, or over a bar cart. It holds up to 16 bottles or can even house a few succulents or twinkle lights. </p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This roundup was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/patrice-williams-4796433" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Patrice J.

<title>Designers Say Toss These Unexpected Items From Your Living Room Before Moving</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/k0gK2Mv0cFAcf31yfGYTnGYVD78=/2121x1414/GettyImages-1197369595-ef768d053f1e4ff6b096e54a9b55cbb3.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/k0gK2Mv0cFAcf31yfGYTnGYVD78=/2121x1414/GettyImages-1197369595-ef768d053f1e4ff6b096e54a9b55cbb3.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="home packed up for a move" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Vladans / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the benefits of moving is that it allows you to take major inventory of all of your belongings/ It’s all too easy to accumulate clutter or hold onto items for “one day,” but when you’re packing your home into various boxes and suitcases, you’re forced to confront all of your possessions and evaluate which pieces are important enough to be transported to a new space. If you’ve completed many moves before, you may find yourself getting picky—we all know how difficult it is to sort through box after box when all you want to do is feel settled. </p><p>We spoke with designers to get the lowdown on the five pieces that truly can be left behind when you’re packing up your space—no feelings of guilt necessary.</p><h2>1. Extra Art Pieces</h2><p>Your favorite artwork will always be a top priority and have a place to shine. Explains designer Pamela O’Brien of <a href="https://pamelahopedesigns.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Pamela Hope Designs</a>, “We always move all good art and favorite pieces to the new home and find the right space for them.” But what about those works that you now consider to be just OK? O’Brien adds, “Many clients have piles of framed art tucked into a guest closet. Most of it is faded, unimportant and uninteresting.” These are the items to let go of once and for all. Says O’Brien, “There is no need to bring any of this with you unless it has extraordinary value, sentimental or otherwise.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/GP_UEvfThcQhFSjH7NVkS_JVrpw=/4909x3272/how-to-pack-transport-artwork-hero-horizontal-b89201a5637f4cacac491325c8e57fe6-912d5c1567cc46faad9a867ec51fc70d.jpeg" alt="packing up artwork" width="4909" height="3272" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Michele Lee</span></figcaption></figure><h2>2. Unused Rugs</h2><p>O’Brien says that like special art pieces, the right rugs will always take precedent. “If you have good rugs, you may keep them for a lifetime,” she says. “We often move rugs to a completely different room in the new house and they work beautifully.” (Just take the opportunity to get your beloved pieces cleaned before the move, she advises.) Any pieces that are iffy should probably  be discarded. “Good rugs are a great investment but cheap rugs often should not make the trip,” O’Brien explains. You shouldn’t feel too bad about parting with such pieces. After all, “[rugs] naturally incur some stains and wear and tear and their size is also so specific to a room,” designer <a href="http://www.courtneysempliner.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Courtney Sempliner</a> says. </p><h2>3. Throw Pillows and Curtains </h2><p>Such pieces have likely seen better days and may even be a bit dated depending on how long you’ve lived in a space, so out they can go. “It always feels good to set up a new home with fresh curtains and throw pillows,” designer <a href="https://ervidesign.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Leah Ervi</a> says. And why not take the time to embrace a new hue in the process? Ervi adds, “The fresh start is a good time to challenge yourself with a brand new color palette, as well.” Don’t forget to replenish pillow inserts, adds Ines Mazzotta of <a href="https://kellyhopterinteriors.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Kelly Hopter Interiors</a>. “Like ‘regular’ pillows, they collect dust and allergens so it’s important to replace them periodically,” she says. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/krdx4Sq5j1YgtVrjthZDGixtaUA=/2121x1414/GettyImages-1212623096-c388174d1dab4ca9b3b96a5090e0586c.jpg" alt="stack of throw pillows" width="2121" height="1414" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Anastasiia Krivenok / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><h2>4. Unwanted Books</h2><p>Stop yourself before you pack boxes of heavy texts that will be a burden to unload: Instead, decide which titles you truly want to keep and donate the rest—or pass some along to friends who may enjoy them. “Moving into a new home is the perfect time to curate your collection of books and to give away the ones that no longer serve you or your living space,” Sempliner explains. “It’s something that most of us don’t take the time to renew or refresh often, so a move is great motivation.” You’ll thank yourself later when you have plenty of free shelf space in your new home, especially if you’re longing for a more minimalist lifestyle. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/tHXh8R4Z-ll6n9gjXH9LuxFhJww=/3072x2048/florencia-viadana-1J8k0qqUfYY-unsplash-9e82285a1e614e0186f1bddb53729d93.jpg" alt="pile of books" width="3072" height="2048" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Florencia Viadana / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure><h2>5. So-So Decor </h2><p>We all have those decorative objects we scooped up solely because they were on sale, as well as items that were trendy at one time but no longer spark joy. Out they go! “I would say throw out anything that doesn't give you a warm and fuzzy feeling,” notes designer <a href="https://www.samcramiam.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Sam Cram</a>. “You should love everything in your home, and if you aren’t head over heels for something—moving is the perfect excuse for getting rid of it! Start fresh in a new home...and curate over time.” After all, the best decorative items are the ones that you collect because they’re meaningful—maybe you pick them up while traveling or purchase something from an artisan you admire. These types of pieces will hold their value for years to come—and perhaps will even spark conversation when guests stop by. </p><p>The beauty of moving into a new space is that you can really take a moment to set your intentions as to how you’d like to live in your new home. Maybe you’re craving less clutter, a more neutral palette, stylish built-ins, you name it. You’ll be able to better accomplish all of these goals by parting ways with the pieces that are just taking up space and not doing much else. Your new living room is waiting for you! </p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/u6IBTR4IRrEjdv0KAACiuqO4Nz8=/1200x801/Stocksy_txp697172252w3300_Small_3382970-0846167266ca4b7ebcf78197862f5d49.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Girl doing homework at a home desk" width="1200" height="801" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Clique Images / Stocksy</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether learning in-person or online, one thing will always be true: <em>homework is a part of life. </em>And no matter how much pushback our children give us, getting it done is a necessity. But it doesn’t have to be complete chore—especially when spaces are designed to be personal, useful, and fun. </p><p>Regardless of your child’s age, grade, or excitement (or lack thereof) around learning, here are some foolproof tips for designing the perfect kid homework area.</p><h2>1. Create a Clutter-Free Space</h2><p>When it comes to creating the perfect workspace, keeping it organized may sound like a no-brainer. But, in the rush to create spaces for work and play, parents often neglect the importance of removing clutter to create a truly distraction-free space.</p><p>The first thing to understand is what clutter actually is. This can look different for every family and child. It can be anything from <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-reduce-paper-clutter-4126046" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">loose papers</a> to toys that shouldn’t have a place on the desk or learning space.</p><p>Some kids love having a bunch of markers, colored pencils, and erasers on their desks while learning. While these aren’t necessarily unrelated to school, they can actually do more harm than good—especially if they become distractions for the child that actually take away from their focus. </p><p>Help your child understand how to categorize items and put away what’s not actually needed. Create <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-drawer-organizers-4154355" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">drawers</a> or on-the-desk organizers where these items can live without getting in the way of focus. Emphasize the importance of being organized in order to stay invested and engaged in school work. </p><h2>2. Keep Necessities Within Reach</h2><p>While removing distractions is a must, on the other end of the equation is the importance of helping prepare your child’s workspace for learning. Necessities are anything from writing utensils and calculators to loose-leaf paper and pencil sharpeners. And, of course, these items will vary based upon student age, class, and learning level. </p><p>The most important thing is to create a workspace that has ‘homes’ for different items so that your child doesn’t have to leave the table to complete a task. An example would be having to get up anytime they need to sharpen a pencil.</p><p>It’s also beneficial to have any supports available in this area, too. For example, if your child has a learning disability and needs a multiplication chart to help them with facts, then make sure this is pinned to the bulletin board, in a top drawer, or otherwise ready for action without having to stop the lesson or practice to find it.</p><h2>3. Create Intentional Pathways</h2><p>When it comes to designing the perfect kid homework area, one important (and often overlooked) element is the ease of access in terms of pathways.</p><p>If your child can't easily get in and out of the space it's annoying and it can become a practical concern, particularly if your child has a mobility issue or challenges with motor skills. Not to mention there more chance of distraction if people can’t easily get passed.</p><p>Be sure to set up your child’s homework area in a less-frequented area, particularly where there is room to set up without feeling cramped or stressed about taking up space. </p><h2>4. Design With Parent Proximity in Mind</h2><p>Depending on your child’s age, there may be quite a bit of adult support needed to complete assignments. It won’t make sense if your child has to keep making trips from an upper-level bedroom to a lower-level kitchen just to ask questions. It could problematic if they can’t be trusted to stay focused independently. </p><p>As you create your kid’s perfect homework area, consider your child’s needs, personality, age, and learning level. You may want to set up a space with parent proximity, especially at first, to make sure you can be readily available when needed.</p><h2>5. Incorporate Natural Lighting</h2><p>It goes without saying that a homework area should be properly lit. This means that having a kid <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-desk-lamps-4165761" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">desk lamp</a>, especially for darker spaces, is non-negotiable. Incorporating natural light, when possible, is easier on the eyes and is especially beneficial if your child is spending more time on a computer. </p><h2>6. Consider Flexible Desk Options</h2><p>A multi-functional and flexible homework station is advantageous. During the week, the desk can be used for homework and at the weekend, it’s a space for building Legos or creating model action figures! </p><p>There are options to use <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-standing-desks-4782916" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">standing desks</a>, movable desks, or even shelves that double as short-lipped kid homework stations. The options are endless and you can be really savvy with your time, space, and effort by creating something that’s more flexible. </p><h2>7.  Make the Space as Unique as the Kid(s) Using It</h2><p>One of the best tips for designing a kid homework desk is to design with intention. As you consider the child(ren) that will be using the space, be sure to incorporate bits of personality, preferred items/activities, or meaningful memorabilia that will make the space special—without being a distraction, of course. </p><p>From pictures on the walls to color-coded items, there are so many ways to make your kid’s homework area not just a space for work, but a space they call their own.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description><![CDATA[From chocolate brown to deep purple to true black, don&#39;t be afraid to rock that dark color on your bedroom walls.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/jVk0-OCn7MyUEpkwmPGqtkiseDg=/1781x1187/how-to-decorate-with-dark-bedroom-walls-350799-hero-ad9bed5fa1e04707b659ba9191f53416.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Decorated bedroom with black walls with lighted bed-side lamp above nightstand" width="1781" height="1187" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Christopher Lee Foto</span></figcaption></figure><p>There’s absolutely nothing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/great-shades-of-white-paint-for-the-bedroom-350789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">wrong with white</a>, pastel, or neutral walls, but if you’re playing it safe just because you fear dark paint will turn your bedroom into a cave, take heart. No matter how dark you go, you can still have a bedroom that’s airy, glamorous, or contemporary...whatever style you like best. The secret is balancing the strong wall color against the rest of the room’s décor.</p><p>One thing you’ll notice in just about every bedroom with dark walls is a white ceiling. This prevents a closed-in, cave-like vibe and helps maintain an airy feeling throughout the room. You can create the same effect with light-colored flooring, too.</p><h2>Chocolate Brown</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/eg1a06WWBXSMGCRJWUWZInVusg4=/1000x667/dark-brown-walls-56a08f723df78cafdaa2b979.jpg" alt="Brown and white bedroom" width="1000" height="667" /><figcaption>A mirror over the bed is an easy way to bounce light around a small room<span class="copyright">Phoebe Howard</span></figcaption></figure><p>Though it might seem counterintuitive, dark walls, when done right, can actually make a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-make-small-room-look-larger-350717" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">small room appear larger</a>. That’s because dark colors visually recede, fooling the eyes into seeing the walls as further away than they really are. Check out the chocolate brown walls in the bedroom here (the paint color is Chocolate Candy by Benjamin Moore). Although this room is small, it doesn’t feel that way thanks to the rich, warm paint, the white ceiling and bedding, and the eye-catching yet unfussy pattern on the rug and shams. Additionally, keeping the palette limited to just two colors creates a feeling of airy simplicity.</p><h2>Deep Purple</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/zrFLBAPcJ3fWgn1c2oBXGpHqUIU=/1280x959/dark-purple-walls-56a08f735f9b58eba4b18f21.jpeg" alt="Bedroom with dark purple walls" width="1280" height="959" /><figcaption>Mix purple with gray, black and white, and it's perfect for a master bedroom<span class="copyright">HGTV</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you like a bit of drama and a touch of contemporary style in your décor, dark walls in an unexpected color are the perfect backdrop. Look at how the clean lines of the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-beds-4150679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">white metal canopy bed</a> pop against the purple paint, while the patterns on the artwork and the shams add just enough contrast to keep things hopping. Using plenty of white in a dark-walled room helps prevent claustrophobia, while touches of shine bounce light around the space for an airy feel.</p><h2>Black</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/yD2hicWmnt7NeXR7KCxXeq4nCF0=/1000x1000/black-bedroom-walls-56a08f733df78cafdaa2b987.jpg" alt="Beautiful bedroom with black walls" width="1000" height="1000" /><figcaption>A white ceiling and white bedding keep black walls soft<span class="copyright">Christine Dovey</span></figcaption></figure><p>Think the darkest color of all is only for vampires or goths? Not when you do black right, as in the gorgeous bedroom shown here. There’s no need to let a dark wall color pigeonhole your decorating style. While glamorous décor most often has a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hollywood-regency-style-bedroom-ideas-4142924" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">creamy, dreamy palette</a> of light neutrals or pastels, black walls take it to a whole new level. And there’s certainly nothing depressing or gloomy about a room filled with fabulous texture, metallic accents, ornate lighting, and whimsical touches, like the zebra figurine on the chair. </p><h2>Dark Red</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/LmXWEYWd75vX6fl-g3ZWsadbgfA=/1000x666/dark-wine-walls-56a08f733df78cafdaa2b981.jpg" alt="Deep red bedroom walls" width="1000" height="666" /><figcaption>Soften strong red walls with white and neutral colors through the rest of the space<span class="copyright">Apartment Therapy</span></figcaption></figure><p>While bright red walls are typically too stimulating for the bedroom, muted shades of red, such as burgundy or the wine shown here (this color is Rookwood Dark Red from Sherwin-Williams), are equally dramatic, yet allow you to get to sleep at night. You can up the excitement factor with a few touches of bright color to play up the strong walls, but keep it under control by limiting those accents to a few pieces of artwork or bedding. A funky ceiling <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/bedroom-lighting-guide-350462" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">fixture</a> is another way to balance the strength of dark walls.</p><h2>Dark Gray</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/PAgx9n5p0Tws8QU28LTxeD7toO4=/1000x1000/dark-gray-walls-56a08f743df78cafdaa2b991.JPEG" alt="Glamorous bedroom with dark gray walls" width="1000" height="1000" /><figcaption>Gray walls are the perfect backdrop for cheery color<span class="copyright">Apartment Therapy</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you really want a gallery wall of artwork to pop, back it up with dark paint instead of white or a soft tint. If you want your entire room to pop, add plenty of metallic shine scattered throughout the space, a lush faux-fur throw blanket, a sumptuous velvet upholstered bed, and a celestially inspired light fixture like the one shown here. While it’s true that dark gray walls are frequently found in <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/minimalist-bedroom-decorating-tips-350651" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">minimalist</a> or other contemporary decorating themes, there’s nothing minimal about the room shown here. Absolutely stunning.</p><h2>Navy</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/f3j68Oik4bOrBiQCVUIFQLfDjF4=/1000x665/dark-blue-walls-56a08f735f9b58eba4b18f1c.jpg" alt="Bedroom with dark blue walls" width="1000" height="665" /><figcaption>Dark blue sets a peaceful vibe<span class="copyright">Our Fifth House</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you decide to go dark on your bedroom walls but don’t want an especially modern feel, choose natural or painted wooden furniture rather than metal, plastic, or mirrored pieces. The traditional look of wood balances the contemporary vibe of bold paint, keeping the overall appearance warm and friendly, as opposed to sleek and modern. But <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/midcentury-modern-bedroom-ideas-4142250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">traditional furniture</a> doesn’t have to mean boring or old-fashioned style like in the bedroom shown here, with its navy blue walls (the paint color is Gentleman’s Gray from Benjamin Moore). The sunburst mirror, patterned drapes, and unfussy light fixture add plenty of modern sensibilities to an otherwise traditional bedroom.</p><h2>Dark Green</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/O5oll8Kxn5PhVfBifZC-bDHUh9Y=/1000x652/dark-green-walls-56a08f733df78cafdaa2b98c.jpg" alt="Traditional bedroom with dark green walls" width="1000" height="652" /><figcaption>Dark green is naturally restful<span class="copyright">Houzz</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-transform-a-boring-bedroom-350734" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">add some spice</a> to an otherwise nice-but-nothing-special bedroom or guestroom? The solution is as simple as a gallon of dark paint in your favorite green hue. This room has plenty of country charm. But imagine it without those strong green walls: cute, but lacking the “wow!” that the bold color inspires. If you want the most decorating bang for your buck, it’s hard to beat the impact of a fresh coat of dark color. Match it to the bedding or a piece of artwork, and you can’t go wrong.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And that makes your kitchen the heart and soul of your home. So when it comes to remodeling, you want to get it right. </p><p>That is why we wholeheartedly endorse a white or mostly <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-to-decorate-your-house-with-white-1274399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">white color scheme</a>. Unlike bolder hues, the neutral shade will not fall victim to fickle decorating trends. To inspire you to create a white kitchen that will get your ticker thumping, behold our 15 favorite examples.</p><h2>Moroccan Fish Scale Backsplash</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/OFcREoRMxsNa-0VYz2zNFBCRQU8=/6883x4589/Blue-Walls-Blue-Backsplash-Kitchen-593856c15f9b58d58af4505e.jpg" width="6883" height="4589" /><figcaption>Blue & White<span class="copyright">Michelle Gage</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interior designer, <a href="https://www.michellegage.co/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Michelle Gage</a> dressed up this <a href="https://www.michellegage.co/happy-havertown-home-renovations" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">white kitchen</a> with a mermaid inspired backsplash. The Moroccan fish scale tiles are by Mercury Mosaics. Their beautiful blue and green colors evoke the sea while giving the cooking space a beachy vibe. The brass accents, which includes the cabinet hardware and kitchen faucet, also make a big stylish, splash. </p><h2>Vintage-Inspired Modern White Kitchen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/QqnJq6tc9CI_kQzpLrMgOUJKx_A=/1280x852/kitchen-with-smeg-5ae7435318ba01003756bc87.jpg" width="1280" height="852" /><figcaption>White retro kitchen with SMEG fridge<span class="copyright">Sarah Phipps Design</span></figcaption></figure><p>The vintage-inspired, modern white kitchen in this charming bungalow remodeled by <a href="http://sarahphippsdesign.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Sarah Phipps Design</a> got an updated look using a combination of new and salvaged building materials. The flat front cabinets are a consignment store find. The brass pendant light over the sink came from World Market. The hexagon <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/marble-backsplash-ideas-4684474" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">marble tiles</a> used to create the backsplash were picked up at Home Depot. The white SMEG refrigerator enhances the overall retro vibe.</p><h2>Glam White Kitchen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/x8KeEGOCIFihHu4v1nkS5wxA3N0=/1000x667/fin-32-pop-of-pink-kitchen-5a47fb0b4e46ba0036caceb6.jpg" width="1000" height="667" /><figcaption>Pink kitchen<span class="copyright">Laura Burleson.</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you crave girlie glamour in your kitchen prepare to fall in love with this cooking space by Laura Burleson. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/white-kitchen-cabinets-4590349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">white cabinetry</a> is topped off with beautiful brass hardware. The drop-dead gorgeous range is from The Majestic Series by Ilve Appliances. The sprinkles on top are the lantern pendant lights painted bold pink.</p><h2>Two-Tones Kitchen Cabinets</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/VQwF3S4wId2U2iYRAeuKseT12g0=/1311x874/5-white-black-blue-gold-all-over-kitchen-594bfbe85f9b58f0fc30e9c5.jpg" width="1311" height="874" /><figcaption>Black & Brass Accents<span class="copyright">Grant K. Gibson Interior Design</span></figcaption></figure><p>Two-toned cabinetry adds dimension to this white <a href="http://grantkgibson.com/portfolio/kitchen/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">cooking space</a> updated by <a href="http://grantkgibson.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Grant K. Gibson Interior Design</a>. The matte, upper cabinets are designer white by Benjamin Moore. The crisp, subway tile backsplash beautifully reflects light throughout the space. The marble countertop is a neutral bridge between the two-toned cabinetry. The brass cabinet hardware compliments the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/black-kitchen-designs-4163964" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">black kitchen</a> range.</p><h2>Breadboard Shaker Style Cabinets</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/OBj9eipX64048mmgX-UODOf04zY=/1000x702/Kitchen1-5ae7575a3037130036e196fb.png" width="1000" height="702" /><figcaption>White kitchen with beadboard shaker cabinets<span class="copyright">Biddy and Brady</span></figcaption></figure><p>When updating the kitchen in this 1940s bungalow, the goal for interior design firm <a href="https://bibbyandbrady.co.nz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Biddy and Brady</a> was to create a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-and-care-for-bergenia-4688589" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeless kitchen</a> that felt harmonious with the home. They chose breadboard shaker cabinets for their classic and enduring appeal. Next, the design team installed something thoroughly modern—an eye-popping geometric backsplash created using diamond cube tile by Napier Ceramic Tiles. The faux stone countertop in light gray adds a pinch of contrast.</p><h2>Simple Updates Make a Big Impact</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/VRFvzABSyfYtkcGv2wA8Zscq6Mw=/1024x683/Rustic-Modern-White-Wood-Farmhouse-Kitchen-599091c30d327a001033781c.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption>Rustic Modern Farmhouse<span class="copyright">Studio McGee</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design team at <a href="https://www.studio-mcgee.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Studio McGee</a> proves that simple changes can make a significant impact in a kitchen. They did only two things to update this <a href="http://www.studio-mcgee.com/portfolio/2017/6/22/park-city-canyons-remodel" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">cooking space</a>. The original dark countertops were swamped out with white marble. The old, oak cabinets got a couple of coats of white paint. The finished result is a kitchen that feels brand-new.</p><h2>Modern Take on the Traditional White Kitchen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/rpWvXdjVpKdFzwtMJWJmf7W92Ow=/3960x2640/4-modern-white-farmhouse-kitchen-Jade-Inter-598f7c65aad52b0011a145df.jpg" width="3960" height="2640" /><figcaption>Boho Modern Farmhouse<span class="copyright">House of Jade Interiors</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here is a modern take on the traditional <a href="http://www.houseofjadeinteriorsblog.com/2015/08/the-modern-farmhouse-project-kitchen-breakfast-nook.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">white kitchen</a> by <a href="http://www.houseofjadeinteriorsblog.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">House of Jade Interiors</a>. The painted walls and cabinets are a shade called snowbound by Sherman-Williams. The marble look countertops are durable quartz by Pental Surfaces. The black pendants lights over the kitchen islands are from Rejuvenation. The natural wood shelves, rattan counter stools, and sprigs of greenery add visual warmth to the fresh, white space.</p><h2>Retro Kitchen That Feels Fresh and Modern</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/qc1_okSjRIfaI-yx8puOJG0dtzM=/3232x2155/fin-31-classic-white-kitchen-5a47faff22fa3a003666bf33.jpg" width="3232" height="2155" /><figcaption>Traditional Cottage<span class="copyright">Holly Mathis</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interior designer, <a href="http://www.hollymathisinteriors.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Holly Mathis</a> gave her modern, cottage <a href="http://www.hollymathisinteriors.com/portfolio/the-original-cottage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">kitchen</a> a sprinkling of retro flavor with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vinyl-flooring-materials-1314764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">vinyl floor tiles</a>. The black and white pattern adds a heaping dose of whimsy.</p><h2>White Brick Wall Instead of Subway Tile</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/rek-hvzqe-0Y_07HgRzB4lMCFbQ=/2500x1667/3-Blakes-London-White-Brick-Rustic-Kitchen-5991cac5d088c00013b02cf3.jpg" width="2500" height="1667" /><figcaption>Nordic Farmhouse<span class="copyright">Blakes London</span></figcaption></figure><p>A white, brick wall sets the tone in this chic, Scandinavian-inspired <a href="http://blakeslondon.com/scandinavian-renovation-london-uk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">kitchen</a> by <a href="http://blakeslondon.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Blakes London</a>. Shelves and lower cabinets in a soft-toned natural wood add textural interest. The countertop was cut from a slab of Carrera marble. The crowning jewel in the cooking space is the white AGA range. </p><h2>Combine White With Bold Colors</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/uNFdvTroT3y8iFmerQRQLHsvmi8=/1024x702/38-kingston-design-remodeling-northern-virginia-maryland-washington-DC-orange-kitchen-featured-image-1024x702-5a6f7afb6edd650036384b07.jpg" width="1024" height="702" /><figcaption>Urban Retro<span class="copyright">Finesse Design Remodeling</span></figcaption></figure><p>White couples beautifully with every shade of the rainbow. In this tiny white <a href="http://www.finesse-design.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">kitchen</a> by <a href="http://www.finesse-design.com/gallery/kitchens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">Finesse Design Remodeling</a>, a painted orange backsplash adds zing. If the bold hue starts to feel tired, refreshing it with paint will be a cinch.</p><h2>Sophisticated White Kitchen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/UL5oG9qiz6E0VYO7fEen4weIjTo=/1500x1022/Litchfield_Clark_9581-5ae4a8708e1b6e0037f4dedd.jpg" width="1500" height="1022" /><figcaption>Traditional<span class="copyright">Turek Design</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here is a sophisticated white kitchen by <a href="http://www.turek-design.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Turek Design</a>. The black marble countertops pop against the traditional white cabinetry. The marble, subway tile backsplash is a luxurious touch. We also love the antique-look brass fixtures that feel way more modern than then their shiny counterparts.</p><h2>White Kitchen for a Busy Young Family</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/fn47XKLjfiRNZlaN04oM27e8BIQ=/1500x1000/jack_and_mare_rocky_butte_13-5a942d3343a10300360e2c74.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption>Yellow accents<span class="copyright">The Jack and Mare Design Build</span></figcaption></figure><p>These flat-front cabinets custom made by the remodeling team at <a href="https://www.thejackandmare.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">The Jack and Mare Design Build </a>give this white <a href="https://www.thejackandmare.com/rocky-butte-remodel" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">kitchen</a> a clean, modern look. The blue kitchen island adds an element of fun. Because a very active young family with pets lives in the home, the floor is waterproof luxury vinyl.</p><h2>White Kitchen Bursting With Color</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/31nIpaLTAnk20MS74iRtCj9_M_M=/1000x662/13-d2-modern-farmhouse-2-5a6f7bfdfa6bcc00377184c5.jpg" width="1000" height="662" /><figcaption>Green accents<span class="copyright">D2 Interieurs</span></figcaption></figure><p>Colorful accents punch up this <a href="http://www.d2interieurs.com/interior-design-projects/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">white kitchen</a> by <a href="http://www.d2interieurs.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">D2 Interieurs</a>. Over the counter are two apple green pendant lights. The rustic wood counter stools are covered with patterned fabric.</p><h2>Pegboard Backsplash</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/eRbUb5vxZCuR9lQviV7PXPK8ogk=/1200x793/Bunker-Workshop-Pet-Board-Kitchen-via-smallspaces.about.com-56a888d95f9b58b7d0f32001.jpg" width="1200" height="793" /><figcaption>Red accent<span class="copyright">Bunker Workshop</span></figcaption></figure><p>The renovation experts at <a href="http://www.bunkerworkshop.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Bunker Workshop</a> added much-needed storage for cooking utensils to this modern white <a href="http://www.bunkerworkshop.com/ld1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">kitchen</a> by installing a red pegboard backsplash. The shiny metal countertops are stainless steel.</p><h2>Scandinavian-Inspired Modern Kitchen</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/XqwVE19bgGIXJLClCo3DjarPlt8=/1199x799/Heidi-Caillier-Design-Mercer-Island-kitchen-white_edited-1-5990bb6d396e5a001076a0c5.jpg" width="1199" height="799" /><figcaption>Mercer Island kitchen<span class="copyright">Heidi Caillier</span></figcaption></figure><p>The interior design firm, <a href="http://heidicaillierdesign.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Heidi Caillier</a> added some windows before creating this Scandinavian-inspired, modern <a href="http://heidicaillierdesign.com/portfolio/mercer-island/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow">kitchen</a>.

Though hardwood is incredibly popular, carpeting is making a comeback, in part due to the innovative new options on the market.</p><p>Carpet is a great choice for bedrooms, dens, or basements where <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hardwood-flooring-pros-and-cons-1977013" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood can feel too cold</a> and sterile, or any room where there is a risk of water damage. Wall-to-wall carpet can provide warmth and add texture to your space.</p><p>If you're considering carpet, here are some of the trendiest ideas this year.</p><h2>Try Natural Fiber Carpet </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/_c-oL8jt-6fdvKscXfcs7OrQOC4=/1080x1350/147811637_444868610194914_7350077244821118999_n-0099e4c9644d4d5b8c1c7f1a59c893f5.jpg" alt="Office with natural fiber carpet " width="1080" height="1350" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Design at Nineteen</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're torn between <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/carpet-vs-hardwood-showdown-1314686" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpet and hardwood</a>, consider a natural fiber carpet. Natural fiber carpet materials such as jute, sisal, wool, or seagrass are a great alternative to hardwood because they offer a similar organic look and feel without the price tag or maintenance that comes with hardwood.</p><h2>Animal Print Is In</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/GDsDsSCJ_of7iaC8MN2CMCl9R5o=/1080x1350/142129798_1594369004099172_9174767727838588324_n-a374939d4fde46fcbf949b2e36afe31e.jpg" alt="Animal print carpet in an office " width="1080" height="1350" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Haus of Harwood Hall</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're trying to incorporate a bit of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-maximalist-style-4685629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximalism</a> into your home, consider a bold animal print carpet. This look isn't for the shy home decorator, but a leopard or cheetah print carpet is a great way to make a statement in any room and add a load of texture.</p><p>If you're worried about overwhelming the space, keep the rest of the decor minimalist.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Go Wild for Stripes</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/41iMnt71soeT0k2WAyikv5EesZM=/1080x1080/73033120_2306992679613046_1943319692884099175_n-47892119fb2b45c3a90316948567ec26.jpg" alt="Black and white striped carpet " width="1080" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Hologram House</span></figcaption></figure><p>Stripes are a great way to make a small room appear longer or wider. This optical illusion draws the eye in and adds depth to any space. We love big, bold stripes, but you can also find carpet in thinner striped patterns for a more subtle, preppy look.</p><h2>Layer Rugs on Carpet </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/t0Z2DQPxn26UaY7QB96YYqNNxFU=/1080x1349/148343948_876531016464119_3659648183836604704_n-1adb2d476bd3420cbbeefc6133ce1f97.jpg" alt="Bedroom with carpet and jute rug on top " width="1080" height="1349" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Home With Kelsey</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just because your home has wall-to-wall carpet doesn't mean you can't incorporate a few area rugs as well. When done correctly, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lay-an-area-rug-over-carpet-2908729" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">layering an area rug on top of the carpet</a> is a great way to add extra texture or update old carpet.</p><p>Here, a lovely boho-inspired jute area rug helps modernize the tan carpet and add a lot of personality to the space. Make sure to pick a rug that complements your carpet rather than tries to compete with it.</p><h2>Try a Vintage Rug </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/YrGHe7-bdVoaFALp7wD0zqJ4XiM=/1080x1350/133704371_812141442976077_2904123714758919126_n-e12c6bf77de040ae8759578af17241c7.jpg" alt="Vintage rug on stairs " width="1080" height="1350" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Lavender Ghost</span></figcaption></figure><p>Installing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/carpet-on-stairs-1822568" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpeting on your stairs</a> can is not only beautiful but incredibly functional as well. Carpeting can add traction to your stairs and create a soft landing in case of an accident. To modernize your stair runner, consider a vintage rug instead of a traditional carpet.</p><p>Installing a vintage Persian or Turkish rug is a great way to add a lot of visual interest to your staircase. Though this can be DIY'd, you may want to hire a professional if your stairs are particularly old or worn.</p><h2>Try a Subtle Pattern </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/NVnUTFJfFw8pQYXsOvCf7VCMfvs=/1080x1350/137222547_107930944592675_108396421136758780_n-b86bf1d212174c1ba226adfd9770870f.jpg" alt="Bedroom with subtle pattern carpet " width="1080" height="1350" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtney Chollet</span></figcaption></figure><p>Patterned carpet is in and it's not hard to see why. An eye-catching patterned carpet not only adds a lot of texture to your space, but it can help an otherwise simple room feel elegant and finished.</p><p>But if a bold, wild pattern such as animal print is too much for you, consider a subtler option. Here, an elegant square pattern lends a touch of interest without overtaking the room. Look for low-key patterns in neutral hues such as gray or white for a contemporary look and feel.</p><h2>Go for Plaid </h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Acc9IEUFeWe4stWYZ_Z0vRf5dY8=/1080x1232/82448122_495329454727784_4932379733612116220_n-8186032a589e44e19196c6d4ad1b1aa1.jpg" alt="Attic space with plaid carpet " width="1080" height="1232" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Dina Holland Interiors</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're planning to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/design-dilemma-patterns-2213501" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">mix patterns in your room</a> or you want one statement pattern, consider a plaid carpet. Traditional yet trendy, plaid is a great way to add depth to your space, and works in nearly any room in your house.</p><p>Bonus point: Plaid carpet acts as a great grid for laying furniture and lining up your space, too!</p><h2>Keep it Simple</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ESRrduEj5KRpoJu72rkrN984w14=/1080x1080/136075653_3951832528189628_1321136328956817369_n-2692403c5f3b46b59f3e97c610da2b71.jpg" alt="Room with soft beige carpet " width="1080" height="1080" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Studio 7 Interiors</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes the classics are just too good to fade away. If you're laying carpet in a frequently used room such as a family room or a living room, a neutral solid-colored carpet is often the best option.</p><p>If you're worried about it feeling outdated, consider a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choose-the-right-area-rug-4105813" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-pile or woven carpet</a> instead of a high-pile. We love a soft tan or beige carpet paired with rich leather furniture and dark accents.</p><h2>Mix and Match Patterns</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/t71syIXRwm0YT8hkr7pUrNC8RB4=/984x1231/151719027_258843412471090_6721944999946073899_n-a407bbc369c54a7cba0799e3ab4f421e.jpg" alt="Room with navy and white carpet " width="984" height="1231" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">AE Design</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're worried that incorporating a patterned carpet into your home limits the rest of your decor, think again. Mixing and matching patterns in your home is very on-trend and a lovely way to add a lot of personality to your space.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It can be as simple as a fresh paint job on unfinished or previously painted brick. Or it can be a simple construction project, where you cover up the brick with drywall, wood, or tile. More involved fireplace makeovers might incorporate a lightweight masonry product called manufactured veneer stone, perfect for do-it-yourself work.</p><p>With many of these fireplace makeovers, the homeowners aim to correct the mistakes of previous owners. Reducing the amount of visible brick is another common theme. In the end, this moderately easy, creative project is one that you will love to do.</p><h2>Before: Lacking Storage</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/u2zXN91f3G94CSGpVwGW1zW-NCA=/1800x1200/DIYPlaybookBefore-5bb249c0c9e77c0026643554.jpg" alt="Fireplace Before Adding Built-Ins" width="1800" height="1200" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">DIY Playbook</span></figcaption></figure><p>With its gorgeous <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/fireplace-mantel-ideas-and-decorating-tips-1976027" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">traditional mantel</a>, this fireplace from <a href="https://thediyplaybook.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">DIY Playbook</a> already had some serious chops.

While they all provide the same basic functions, not all systems are created equal. Whether you're building a new house or your current garage opener is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/garage-door-repairs-and-maintenance-1398148" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">broken</a>, you might be surprised by the breadth of options currently on the market.</p><p>There's chain-drive, belt-drive, screw-drive, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-make-garage-doors-less-noisy-1398030" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultra-quiet models</a>, as well as options with WiFi connectivity. You can also find modern smart home-enabled openers, which allow you to control your system from anywhere. To save you time on your search, we researched the best garage door openers.</p><p>Ahead, the best garage door openers.</p><p>The Chamberlain Bright LED Smartphone-Controlled Garage Door Opener (model B1381) is a high-quality product with all the bells and whistles a homeowner could want. For starters, it's got a built-in LED light bright enough to illuminate your entire garage. Plus, with smartphone compatibility, you can open and close it from anywhere using the myQ app.</p><p>This powerful garage opener system lifts your door effortlessly and smoothly, and the extra-quiet belt drive is reinforced with steel for long-term reliability. It comes with a wireless keypad, two car remotes, a wall control panel, and two safety sensors. And thanks to its backup battery, it'll still work even if your power goes out.</p><p>If you're buying a complete garage door opener, you're looking for a product that includes an actual motorized opener and various accessories. For this reason, the prices don't range very drastically. However, some are more budget-friendly than others, like the BeamUP Workhorse (model BU100). This affordable apparatus is easy to set up and install—no special tools needed.</p><p>It smoothly and quietly opens garage doors of virtually any size and configuration. The Workhorse operates with a heavy-duty chain drive and a powerful, reliable motor. Additionally, it has a built-in LED security light with an energy-efficient bulb that never needs replacing. This garage door opener also works with Alexa, Apple Watch, IFTTT, and HomeLink.</p><p>The best smart garage door opener is the Genie SilentMax Connect (model 3053-TV). It can be synced to any Alexa-enabled devices or Google smart home hub. Thanks to its integrated Aladdin Connect technology, you can open, close, and monitor your garage anywhere from your smartphone or tablet using the app or voice control.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/garage-door-openers-go-high-tech-1398022" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-tech garage opener</a> has a strong steel-reinforced rail system, which is easy to install without any additional hardware. It comes with two pre-programmed remotes plus a wall-mounted control panel. As the name suggests, the SilentMax is also notably quiet.</p><p>The Chamberlain Ultra-Quiet and Strong Garage Door Opener (model B550) is engineered with an incredibly resilient steel-reinforced belt drive. With a MED Lift Power System, high-grade materials, and a reliable design, you can count on smooth and quiet performance for many years.</p><p>This garage opener has built-in smartphone capabilities. You can manage, monitor, and operate it through the myQ app. The system includes two remote controls with impressive range plus a wireless exterior keypad.</p><p>The Genie MachForce (model 4062-TNMSO) has special screw-drive technology, which allows it to open quickly, smoothly, and quietly. Its 2 HPc DC motor offers impressive power and speed twice as fast as most other belt-drive models.</p><p>This heavy-duty garage opener can open even the heaviest doors up to 7 feet tall. It comes with two remotes, which are pre-programmed for immediate use, and a wall-mounted control panel with lit-up buttons.</p><p>The Craftsman Chain Drive Opener (model CMXEOCG471) is a durable product with rugged steel construction. The 0.5-HP motor is ideal for daily use on a standard 7-foot garage door. It comes with safety sensors, two remote controls, and a wireless keypad, though you can also operate it through the myQ app.</p><p>The Chamberlain Secure View (model B4545) has a built-in motion-activated camera, which provides live 360-degree video of your garage. Since it's WiFi-enabled for myQ, you can watch the stream from anywhere right on your smartphone or tablet. The camera even has a night-vision lens, so you can <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/garage-door-openers-security-1398160" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">monitor your home</a> 24 hours a day.</p><p>Also, you'll get alerts on the myQ app when movement is detected. You can operate your door using the two included remotes, wall control panel, or right through the app.</p><p>Most modern garage door openers are designed for quiet operation, but the extremely quiet Skylink Atoms (model ATR-1723BKW) rivals the rest. Though it runs on a powerful DC motor, you can count on smooth operation with very minimal noise. The Atoms also has a built-in LED light, which illuminates your garage as it opens and stays on long enough for you to collect your things and head into your house.</p><p>This garage opener has WiFi connectivity, which you can sync with the Orbit app. Control your door from anywhere and get instant notifications when it's open or closed. The bundle comes with an anti-break-in drive system, two passcode-protected remotes, a wireless keypad, and an LCD wall console with an automatic timed closing feature.</p><p>Unlike most garage door openers, the LiftMaster Elite Series 8500 Jackshaft Operator mounts to the wall instead of the ceiling. Keep in mind, this product doesn't work with roll-up doors. It's compatible with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/single-panel-vs-sectional-garage-doors-1398094" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">sectional garage doors</a>, and you'll need a front-mount torsion bar system.</p><p>The powerful P3 motor provides smooth and reliable operation, and the wall-mounted design makes it extra-quiet by eliminating vibrations and sounds through the ceiling. Also, the included motion detector automatically projects a light beam across your garage entry. This opener also comes with a remote and a myQ control panel.</p><p>If you have a tall door, we recommend the Sommer Direct Drive Garage Door Opener (model 1042V002). The rail is long enough for 8-foot doors without the need for an extension kit. It comes with installation materials, safety sensors, a wall control panel, and a remote.</p><p>Unlike models with belts or screw drives, this German-made garage opener has only one moving part. The motor sprocket glides along the fixed drive on a steel rail, which makes for super smooth and quiet performance. Sommer offers a lifetime warranty on this unit, too, so you can have peace of mind about your purchase.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Garage Door Opener</h2><h3>Drive type</h3><p>Garage door openers work in a variety of ways. A chain-drive model raises and lowers doors with a metal chain — these tend to be inexpensive and able to handle heavier doors, but they’re loud. A belt-drive opener uses a belt and operates more smoothly and quietly. Screw-drive openers, which lift doors with a threaded steel rod, are also quiet and don’t require much maintenance. Finally, a direct-drive opener operates as a single unit — the whole contraption moves to lift the door. These tend to be the quietest, smoothest mechanisms available.</p><h3>Horsepower</h3><p>You’ll also want to consider the horsepower of your opener. Typically, 1/2 horsepower will work for most doors in newer homes. If you have a heavier solid wood door, though, you may want to opt for 3/4 horsepower so it can lift it with ease. You can also get 1 and 1 1/2 horsepower models, but those are a better fit for commercial or special situations.</p><h3>Security </h3><p>Since 1993, all garage door openers have been required to have a special reversing mechanism to prevent closure if a child, pet, or car is in the way—but in terms of additional security features, you get what you pay for. If safety is a top concern, opt for a model that changes the access code after each use to prevent a break-in.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What size garage door opener do I need?</h3><p>Most openers are designed to work with all <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/guide-to-garage-door-size-1398067" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">sizes and configurations</a> of garage doors. However, if your garage door is tall (usually 8 feet), you'll need one with a rail long enough to accommodate the height. Also, if yours is particularly heavy or has double doors, you might need one with extra horsepower.</p><h3>How do you program a garage door opener?</h3><p>Virtually all garage door opener units have a "Learn" button. To <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-program-garage-door-openers-1398155" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">pair your remote</a> with your opener, press this button. It should activate an indicator light for 30 seconds to a minute. While it's lit, press and hold the main <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/when-your-garage-door-opens-by-itself-3969581" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">open/close</a> button on the remote until the light on the overhead unit starts blinking. The blinking light tells you your garage door opener is programmed with the remote.</p><h3>How do you install a garage door opener?</h3><p>It's crucial for garage door openers to be installed correctly so they operate safely and effectively. You might consider hiring a professional, but if you'd rather go the DIY route, these are <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-long-to-install-new-garage-door-1398163" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">the basic steps</a>:</p><p>1. Read over the instructions and make sure you have all the parts and necessary tools.</p><p>2. Assemble the carriage tube per the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>3. Attach the carriage tube to the front of the main power unit.</p><p>4. Mount the header bracket to secure the carriage tube to the wall over the door.</p><p>5. Hang the main power unit from the ceiling</p><p>6. Wire the opener control box, then mount it to the wall.</p><p>7. Attach the connector bracket to the door, then fasten it to the carriage arm.</p><p>8. Plug in the safety sensor device to prevent it from closing on anything in the way.</p><h3>How do you open a garage door manually that has a garage door opener?</h3><p>Your garage door most likely has a manual cable, which disconnects from the opener chain, allowing you to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/troubleshooting-common-garage-door-problems-1398186" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">open it manually</a>. There might also be some sort of small key you can use to unlock the manual cable (if it's not already unlocked).</p><p>Pull down hard on the cord to release the door. Then lift it with your hands, pushing it all the way up to make sure it stays in place and doesn't fall back down.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This roundup was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/theresa-holland-5095480" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theresa Holland</a>, a professional writer and homeowner seasoned in reviewing, researching, and testing home goods and home improvement products.

<title>7 Realtor-Approved Tricks to Stage Your Home Even If You&apos;re Not Selling</title>

<description><![CDATA[We spoke with two top real estate agents from around the US to get their tips and tricks for staging a home... even if you&#39;re not planning on selling.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/a1WCXag7ldhgMeMxrQzXCuPDdSg=/4134x2756/34PlazaStreetEast1005-5_VS_021-28db35fe94e74a2d8f5dfd6f61b9973f.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="A rectangular bedroom with a round mirror mounted on the wall" width="4134" height="2756" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Lesley Semmelhack</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you hear the phrase “home staging," it's likely that one specific scenario springs to mind: making a home look appealing to potential buyers. But staging a home doesn’t have to be just about preparing a space for prospective owners. We spoke with two top real estate agents on what they’ve learned about staging a home and how we can all incorporate these tips into our daily lives.</p><p>It turns out that while neutral paint and decluttering your home are key in prepping a space, there is so much more to staging than you might realize.</p><h2>Consider the Flow of Your Furniture</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/bcY-OOzGWX6usEhQrnlz3sak7zE=/4134x2756/34PlazaStreetEast1005-1_VS_01-527cf87ca58947a2b181c137c9c4aa01.jpg" alt="A living area with primary sofas arranged perpendicular to the opening" width="4134" height="2756" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Lesley Semmelhack</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc-real-estate/agents/park-slope/lesley-semmelhack/6150" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Lesley Semmelhack</a>, a Brooklyn-based real estate agent with The Corcoran Group, told us that one of the first things she notices about a home is how it flows. “Furniture placement is very important, as it literally dictates how people move through a space.”</p><p>A super clean house is key for staging, but even that can't save you from feeling visually cluttered. When designing a room, consider how your furniture placement dictates exactly how you move through your home. “Placing a sofa perpendicular to the doorway to an adjoining room can visually lead people ahead,” explained Lesley. “While positioning it parallel to the opening can create the sense of a barrier.”</p><h2>Decorate for the Season</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Ilst3pxDK51jAXoFNaN8A9Dzbh4=/2756x4134/34PlazaStreetEast1005-4_01_VS_01-55c3d9a677764048998c764468f3f76f.jpg" alt="Flowers on the sink in a neutral-colored bathroom " width="2756" height="4134" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Lesley Semmelhack</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lesley also advises her clients to consider the season. While it's common practice to remove personal belongings for staging, you can still keep your personality. <strong>“</strong>When staging a home, I always like to include some seasonally appropriate details—something as simple as fruit or flowers on a countertop can set the tone. For example, apples for fall, quince for winter, or tulips for spring.” </p><p>These details have the added benefit of giving prospective buyers the chance to “[look] forward to the experiences they will have.” But even if you're not selling, this is a great way to enhance a space while allowing room for small changes and updates all year long. “Rich, cozy color palettes with lighter accents are ideal for the cooler months, but I move toward lighter colors across the board in spring,” said Lesley.</p><h2>Stick to One Type of Wood</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/R0aVXbQyP191qmffW9U0WACJVc0=/4134x2756/34PlazaStreetEast1005-2_VS_011-fd5ed813c5854eee9cc4f68c37d7f934.jpg" alt="Living and dining areas with a single floor type throughout" width="4134" height="2756" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Lesley Semmelhack</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve taken on the easy staging fixes and something still feels weird, Lesley has another insider tip. “Mixing wood tones can be a challenge to pull off successfully, and an overabundance of mix-matched wood is something I have to fix frequently.”</p><p>Luckily, it’s a common problem with a fairly easy solution. “Many homes, especially historic ones, have wood floors, wood cabinets and trim, and wood furniture… all in different shades. It can be an overpowering amount of the same material! So, I’ll paint the walls or cabinets a light color to neutralize the overall look.”</p><h2>Soften Your Angles</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/a1WCXag7ldhgMeMxrQzXCuPDdSg=/4134x2756/34PlazaStreetEast1005-5_VS_021-28db35fe94e74a2d8f5dfd6f61b9973f.jpg" alt="A rectangular bedroom with a round mirror mounted on the wall" width="4134" height="2756" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Lesley Semmelhack</span></figcaption></figure><p>“A lot of homes have rectangular rooms, lined with rectangular windows with rectangular panes,” said Lesley. This is all enhanced with boxy furniture, and that’s often where homeowners go wrong.</p><p>“In situations like this, it’s all about softening the angles. I like to add circular coffee tables, round mirrors, and plush furniture with organic shapes. It creates a great balance.”</p><h2>Work From the Outside In</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/H6y9z0ys_lUMOihzvNJlvbdn4Jc=/814x513/image013-2aec72d2c7b847a1be31f7a1d7ad4389.jpg" alt="the front of a home with well manicured landscaping" width="814" height="513" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Rose Sklar</span></figcaption></figure><p>Florida-based real estate agent <a href="https://www.coldwellbanker.com/Coldwell-Banker-Realty-12629c/Rose-Sklar-568861a" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">Rose Sklar</a> of Coldwell Banker suggests starting before you even enter your home. “The front door and curb appeal are critical,” she said.</p><p>“Clean up your landscaping, [give] your front door a fresh coat of paint, and be bold with color. [Add fresh] mulch, trim the garden, add some flowers or a potted plant and change the door hardware if needed.”</p><h2>Update the Small Stuff</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/uREg5HeQRsxim94N9cI9W6dMjFw=/814x541/image011-42d19fa3fe5e4bcc909b3302da00510e.png" alt="A living area that is light and bright with white sofa and chairs and a big window without window treatments" width="814" height="541" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Rose Sklar</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to staging a home, it’s easy to pick out the big things that need changing, like carpeting or paint colors. But Rose told us that the smaller accents play a huge role in the feel of a space, too. “Dated light fixtures and draperies make a room feel tighter and smaller,” she said. “An easy fix can be removing heavy cornices, balloon curtains, or dark draperies that keep out the light. This can brighten up the room and make it feel larger.”</p><p>If you prefer a moody space, you can still create a more welcoming vibe. For a  “darker, cozy feel,” said Rose, “just removing some oversized furniture can make a room feel more airy, giving it a more open feel. Lighten up the rug color and some light-neutral accessories.”</p><h2>Work With Your Floorplan–Not Against It</h2><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/KR_NJ7OKkoKKIwYa6e4Cp4IAiQw=/843x561/image009-bdf88f73d0ab43cdb3a1a492c7057e7e.jpg" alt="home staging tips" width="843" height="561" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Rose Sklar</span></figcaption></figure><p>A difficult floor plan can feel like a massive hurdle when staging a home, but Rose has tricks for this, too. “The key is to utilize furniture that is scaled properly to the room. Try and create small spaces that work together, using rugs to designate where the spaces begin and end.”</p><p>This doesn’t just apply to large-scale rooms. “If you have small spaces, lighten up the color to create the illusion of more space. Make sure the ceiling is not dark as this closes in the feel of the tight space. Remove dark draperies and let the sunshine in. LED lighting is king.”</p><p>One thing is for sure: whether you’re looking to make a few small tweaks for your own day-to-day style or you’re hoping to make a great first impression on guests, real estate agents know what it takes to make a home truly shine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This tree has a unique, twisting form, draping pine branches, and attractive blue-green needles. It's compact, slow-growing and irregular shape means it can be an interesting specimen tree positioned in the middle of a garden lawn.</p><p>It does need to be trained to form a central trunk; otherwise, it won't have such an upright, pleasing weeping formation. Instead, it'll develop a rather untidy, sprawling, shrub-like appearance. No two specimens will look the same - no matter how much pruning and trimming you do.</p><p>As the plant matures, the twisting, pendulous branches can reach the ground and begin to act as a creeping ground cover. Weeping white pines also needs the right conditions to thrive - so they aren't necessarily trees for beginners.</p><h2>How to Grow Weeping White Pine Trees</h2><p>Your weeping white pine will perform best located in a sunny position and planted in moist, fertile, well-drained and acidic soil.</p><p>This species has a preference for cool climates, and it isn't a good choice for a city garden. Too much urban pollution can result in the tree producing fewer branches and shorter, less healthy, even yellowing needles.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/0tF-V4T5QEoDXdfDVPyf75nj-os=/4000x2670/weeping-white-pine-profile-5074330-03-54f14400fbd441dcab57e7bd9fe30f20.JPG" alt="Weeping white pine tree branches with green needle-like leaves closeup" width="4000" height="2670" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/it_kE91p-WV3RoKsMUABSrT6lNw=/4000x2670/weeping-white-pine-profile-5074330-04-e4782a5cc6964bffae9422d253d0a0a2.JPG" alt="Weeping white pine tree with draping branches against blue and cloudy sky" width="4000" height="2670" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/w2-JDgpdxGN1Lz5nL5Fz_fjqa6c=/4000x2670/weeping-white-pine-profile-5074330-05-79360969813744a794d16cebaa138b3f.JPG" alt="Weeping white pine tree branches with blue-green needles and long pine cones hanging" width="4000" height="2670" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Light</h2><p>While your weeping white pine is growing, it'll cope fine in a partial shade position, but once it's established, it prefers to get plenty of sun.</p><h2>Soil</h2><p>These trees will grow in most <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-do-i-find-out-my-soil-type-2130788" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">soil types</a> providing they are moist, fertile and well-drained. They do, however, have a preference for acidic soils and aren't fans of heavy, compacted clay.</p><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-mulch-1402413" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mulching around the base</a> of the tree can help to preserve moisture, keep the roots cool, and will also reduce the alkalinity of the soil. If the soil has a high pH level, this can result in needle chlorosis (the foliage can turn yellow because of a lack of chlorophyll).</p><p>Using some of the dropped needles can be a perfect mulching material.</p><h2>Water</h2><p>Weeping white pines like to be kept consistently moist. If you live in an area that experiences periods of drought, they'll need frequent watering. They won't tolerate standing water either, though. This can cause <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/treat-and-prevent-root-rot-4768757" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">root rot</a> and chlorosis.</p><h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2><p>If you live in a very hot and dry region, this tree won't be right for your garden. They're not a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/twenty-drought-tolerant-trees-3269649" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">drought-tolerant species</a> and do best in cooler climates. They can't cope with salty conditions either. They won't be suited to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-coastal-landscaping-4781309" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">coastal gardens</a> or locations downhill from heavily winter gritted roads. If you have cold conditions through the winter, you may find that the needles don't retain their blue tones over this period.</p><h2>Fertilizer</h2><p>Your weeping white pine will appreciate being fertilized in the spring with a variety that is highly acidic and designed for evergreen species.</p><h2>Pruning</h2><p>If you want to avoid your weeping white pine developing a sprawling, low, untidy shape, you'll need to train it from a young age. You want to encourage it to have a single, tapered, tall central leader. It can take a few years of careful, structural pruning while the tree is young to achieve the desired form.</p><h2>Commons Pests/Diseases</h2><p>Weeping white pine is susceptible to several diseases and pests. They can be attractive to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-aphids-2539837" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain aphids</a>, bark beetles, spruce mites and pine weevils.</p><p>Their biggest problems tend to be <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/prevent-rust-fungus-1316106" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">forms of rust</a> and blight. White pine blister rust on the bark is the most serious disease, and it can kill off your tree.</p><p>This fungus causes the needles on the branches to turn yellow and then a rust-like red. Cankers then start to develop on the branches which can ooze white sap. Orange spores are also sometimes released from these cankers in the spring. Infected branches should be removed to try to limit the spread.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The Best Lamps for Every Room in Your Home</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/1Z7z9mZ89pFZixgYA-NwxhVesbc=/800x800/Huron2622TableLamp-d3fa156ff1574d85b6d543358361771c.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[The right lamp can make any room more inviting. We found the best and brightest lamps on the market, no matter what space you&#39;re decorating.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lamps provide light in an area that may not otherwise have any, but they're also a great way to change the vibe of any room and add some personality to your space. If you want to update your decor and your room’s <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/interior-lighting-design-basics-1313467" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">ambiance</a> without spending a ton of money on furniture, the best place to start is with the lighting. </p><p>Some lamps are low-profile and add some character without demanding too much attention, while others are meant to become the focal point of a room. From orb-style bedside lamps to architecturally-inspired, modern floor lamps, we found the best lamps for illuminating your entire home.</p><p>With its slim profile and warm walnut finish, the Brightech Carter Floor Lamp sets the tone in any room. While the base is somewhat contemporary, the neutral linen shade and walnut pole create a mid-century modern style that anyone who wants some extra warmth in their space can appreciate. </p><p>The base is only 11 inches in diameter, so while it can stand alone as a statement piece, it can also fit into <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-floor-lamps-for-lighting-1391158" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">tight corners</a> next to chairs, sofas, or dresser. Assembly is easy, although the lamp shade arrives disassembled, which is convenient for shipping purposes but does add a few extra steps when you're setting up.</p><p>With its clean lines and contemporary design, this 26-inch table lamp brings some <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/industrial-chic-style-2213412" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">industrial vibes</a> to your space. The frame has three legs that come together to form an X at the base, creating an open silhouette that’s eye-catching but not intrusive. </p><p>The ivory lamp shade finishes off the look, warming up the aesthetic and balancing out the metal. The base comes in four finishes—antique brass, blackened bronze, brushed nickel, and white—so you're sure to find one that fits into any decor. Place it on your nightstand, side table, or console, either on its own or with small decorative pieces like candles and plants.</p><p>The Markey Desk Lamp is beautiful, functional, and ideal for any desk setup. The slim design levels up the look of any desk without taking up too much space, and the lamp head rotates, so you can direct the light exactly where you need it without moving the lamp around.</p><p>As an added bonus, it comes with a built-in power outlet, so you can charge your phone or laptop without having to deal with unwieldy cords plugged into far away sockets. Not only that, but it's also Smart Home compatible if you have a smart outlet. Whether you work on a tiny table or a large desk, this lamp is sure to make your WFH situation much more manageable.</p><p>The FADO Table Lamp is an orb-style fixture that illuminates your bedroom with a soft, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/warm-lighting-2175144" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">warm light</a> that’s ideal for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-pick-a-bedside-lamp-350459" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">winding down at night</a>. When turned on, the minimal design is reminiscent of a full moon, casting a glow that has just the right amount of brightness without being overwhelming. </p><p>The light is controlled by a toggle switch that’s integrated into the cord, so you can easily turn it on and off when you’re lying in bed. At 10 inches in diameter, it takes up a decent amount of space, but since it doubles as a decor piece, you probably won't mind having it be the star of your bedside table.</p><p>Salt lamps add a unique ambiance to your space by casting a soft warm glow across the room. While there are many options out there, you can't go wrong with the Barton Salt Lamp, which is made from natural pink salt crystals that come directly from the Himalayan mountains. </p><p>When surrounded by the pink-toned salt, the 15-watt light bulb inside emits a warm amber glow that’s calming and purifying. Bonus: You can control the amount of light with the dimmer switch integrated into the cord. And take note that because it's made of natural materials, the size, color, and shape of the lamp will vary, so no two are exactly alike.</p><p>If you’re looking for a modern floor lamp with clean lines and an architectural-inspired silhouette, the Archiology Modern Arched Floor Lamp is the ideal solution. The curved metal frame gives the lamp a slight arch that allows it to sit directly above your couch or your bed, providing light exactly where you need it. </p><p>To make things easy, it’s operated by a floor rocker switch and has a 60-inch power cord that lets you conveniently place it wherever you want, even if it’s not near an outlet. The lamp comes in black and gold finishes, so it fits in with both warm and cool tones.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/classic-farmhouse-style-2213409" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">farmhouse-style lamp</a> is a charming way to illuminate any rustic-inspired space. It checks all the boxes with a resin base and distressed gray finish complete with traditional sculpted detailing and a linen shade. The light, antique-inspired finish is guaranteed to add warmth to your space, especially when paired with a brown leather sofa or white linens.</p><p>It also comes with a three-way rotary switch, which lets you precisely control the amount of light. Set the mood with low light, or totally brighten up your space when you need it—this is a lamp that's nothing if not functional.</p><h2>What to Look For in a Lamp</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>All lamps have one major job—to light up your space—but there are different types of lamps and they do different things. Floor lamps are typically meant to light up the whole room, while the illumination that comes from table lamps is generally more concentrated into a smaller space. Desk lamps usually provide task lighting, although you can also buy floor task lamps that are designed for reading. Consider what type of lighting you need, how bright you want it to be, and whether you want certain benefits like Smart Home compatibility or dimming functionality.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Another thing to consider is size. Be sure to consider the lamp's measurements, including the base and the shade, especially if you're working with a tight space. While a certain floor lamp might look slim enough to fit in a tight corner, its base could be too bulky. Similarly, be sure to identify exactly where a table lamp is going to go first so you can avoid buying an overly bulky or heavy piece.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Of course, design—or aesthetic—is an important part of the equation too. While you want to find a lamp that’s functional and the appropriate size for your space, you also want to make sure that you actually like how it looks. Choose a lamp that’s appropriate for your decor and then consider things like color and finish (metal, matte, wood) to find the perfect fit. Lamps are an excellent way to add some personality and ambiance to your space, so have fun with them, especially if you buy one that has a removable lamp shade you can replace to switch things up.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lindsay-boyers-4693301" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Lindsay Boyers</a> writes about lifestyle, home, and decor for The Spruce.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/8c7bfaoo1bhezWrYQl58cfSiEK4=/2001x1334/SPR-Home-v1-The-7-Best-Mold-Removers-of-2021-4583978-primary-69e2398ca7854e2f8b1f9ec66776cc74-3b94bb9a67e54cf088538c9f233cf2c8.jpeg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Best Mold Removers" width="2001" height="1334" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mold can be pernicious and invasive—in other words, harmful and hard to get rid of! Finding an effective mold remover is so important because <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/identifying-mold-vs-mildew-4799138" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">mold and mildew</a> can be unsightly but also may pose a hazard to your health. Products targeted at killing mold spores typically are sprayed onto affected areas; some mold removers require some elbow grease after application, while others are spray-it-and-forget-it formulas that work on their own. </p><p>Whether your mold problem is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-mold-4163846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">inside or outside the home</a>, here are the top mold removers.  </p><p>Stop mold and mildew growth with a powerful, effective formula like RMR-141 RTU. This is an EPA-registered mildewstat, which means it's a chemical agent that is capable of inhibiting the growth of mildew. It has been proven effective against 141 different microorganisms and will kill mold, mildew, bacteria, and more. Its claim to fame is its ability to clean, disinfect, and deodorize non-porous surfaces.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that this <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-mold-4163846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">mold remover</a> is designed specifically to kill mold and mildew fungus that may be growing on porous surfaces. However, it is not a mold stain remover—so if months or years of mold and mildew build-up have left behind black or green staining, you may need to use a separate product to remove the discoloration. </p><p>This mold remover doesn’t just single-handedly eliminate mold and mildew, it also inhibits the growth of new spores. MoldArmor Rapid Clean Remediation is a mold preventative that’s safe for use on a long list of non-porous surfaces, including laminate, sealed fiberglass, acrylic, glass, sealed grout, glazed ceramic, sealed granite, vinyl, and more. This makes it a great defense in damp or humid areas of the home, such as the bathroom or a screened porch. It’s safe for both outdoor and indoor use, but be sure that you have adequate ventilation since the fumes of this mold preventative can be powerful. </p><p>The formula is a one-step sanitizer, disinfectant, and mold and mildew remover—just spray it on the surface to be treated, follow the directions for wait time depending on your application use, and then rinse or wipe it away. This makes it super easy to deal with your existing mold and mildew problems while reducing future growth. </p><p>For a more natural approach to removing mold and mildew that doesn’t require strong chemicals, consider the plant-based Botanical Decon Disinfectant from Benefect. Some mold removers contain strong chemical agents that call for you to wear PPE (like eye protection or gloves) and produce strong fumes that require ventilation. On the other hand, Botanical Decon is a more gentle formula that has no chemicals, dyes, or health warnings. It requires no rinsing and is safe for contact with skin, food surfaces, and more.</p><p>At the same time, this product proves effective in the war against mold and mildew. It’s registered with the EPA as a mildewstat and fungicidal product, and also kills bacteria and viruses. The proprietary formula uses Thymol, derived from the essential oil of Thyme, to produce results. In addition, Benefect incorporates chemistry techniques to create a long-lasting surfactant system that assists in preventing the growth of mold and mildew. </p><p>Wood exposed to the elements is frequently plagued with mold, mildew, algae, and other growths. Naturally porous, this organic material makes a natural host for these substances, but the discoloration and rot that they cause can bring serious headaches for homeowners. Treat your deck material, fences, outdoor furniture, or other exposed <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/clean-mold-off-wood-4767277" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood surfaces</a> with Wet and Forget Mold Remover.</p><p>This slow-release product penetrates the porous surface of wood and begins to treat the existing mold and mildew problems. It doesn’t require any scrubbing or rinsing and contains no bleach or caustic materials. Don’t be disappointed if you don’t see instant results when you apply this mold remover to wooden surfaces around your home; the formula requires extended treatment time and it can take several days or more to note a visible difference. In addition, each time it rains, the product is reactivated and continues to reduce mold or mildew over time. </p><p>Once mold or mildew has been eradicated, you can use Wet and Forget to preserve the look of your wood over time. If you see mold or mildew reappear, simply reapply the product to continue to ward off its growth.  </p><p>Mold can easily grab hold of fabrics, resulting in odor, discoloration, and staining. This is especially true of fabrics in damp, humid environments—like on outdoor furniture for the patio or pool. Concrobium Mold Control Aerosol offers an easy, effective way to apply mold remover to fabric surfaces like furniture, cushions, curtains, and more. </p><p>An effective formula is combined with an aerosol applicator for a fine mist that covers the surface area evenly without oversaturation when applied according to the directions. You don’t need to rub or scrub it in; instead, as it dries, the product kills mold at the roots. This EPA-registered product contains no bleach, making it a good choice for treating fabrics and other soft materials. </p><p>The easy application of Mold Armor E-Z House Wash Mold and Mildew Remover makes it easy to clean large areas of concrete that have become stained or slippery from mold and mildew. Simply attach your outdoor hose to the bottle, evenly spray the product across the surface to be treated, and wait 10 minutes before rinsing with water from the hose. This application method beats using a small squeeze trigger bottle to dispense product over large areas like concrete driveways, sidewalks, porches, or patios. </p><p>Aside from use as a mold remover for concrete, this product can be used on many outdoor surfaces like vinyl siding, stucco, aluminum, painted wood, brick, and more. One other fact worth noting is that it won’t harm plants when used as directed, making it a good choice if you want to preserve your landscape while dealing with unsightly mold and mildew. </p><p>It’s no secret that the moist, damp conditions of the bathroom make it an ideal host for the growth of mold and mildew. However, you can win the war against <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tricks-keep-bathroom-mold-free-326859" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">mold in the bathroom</a> with the help of a targeted formula, like Microban24 Bathroom Cleaner. A force to be reckoned with when dealing with soap scum, this bathroom cleaner will make hard surfaces shine while also destroying harmful microorganisms. </p><p>Proven effective against <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/different-types-of-mold-4772562" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aspergillus niger</a>, this mold remover also serves to clean and disinfect surfaces—making it a one-step solution for keeping your bathroom free of fungus, bacteria, and viruses. After deep cleaning any surfaces currently plagued by mold or mild, apply Microban24 every 7 days to prevent future mold growth. </p><h2>What to Look For in a Mold Remover </h2><h3>Type</h3><p>There are two primary types of formulas for treating mold and mildew. Look for these terms to understand what the product can do in treating your mold problem. </p><ul><li>Fungicide: Kills mold or mildew systems at the roots</li><li>Mildewstat: Prevents the regrowth of mold and mildew spores</li></ul><p>It’s worth noting that many products are a combination of these two mold remover types, which is what most homeowners will want to effectively solve the problem for good. </p><h3>Effectiveness</h3><p>One way to determine a product’s effectiveness is to check that it is EPA-registered. The bottle or container should be marked with an EPA registration number as proof that it has been tested and registered with the EPA as a fungicide or mildewstat. </p><p>Many products work quickly to kill mold, with some fast-acting formulas requiring just one minute of treatment time. Others require up to 15 minutes or more. Whether or not the mold returns depends on how well you follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use, whether or not the product includes treatment to prevent future mold growth, and whether or not you take steps to prevent future moisture or humidity problems in damp areas. </p><h3>Application</h3><p>Removing mold or mildew may sound like a tough task, but choosing the right product can make application easier. For indoor applications, many mold removers come in spray bottles that give thorough, even coverage–even in hard-to-reach areas. Take note of whether or not the product you choose requires scrubbing after application. In overhead areas, like above a shower, this could be more challenging and you may find it easier to look for a product that requires no elbow grease. </p><p>When mold or mildew is outside of the home, you might look for a larger concentrate product that can be diluted to cover many square feet of siding, decking, or other materials. Some outdoor mold removers come in bottles that are ready to be attached to your garden hose for faster, even application. </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do mold removers work? </h3><p>Products designed to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-mold-4163846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">get rid of mold</a> work by killing the spore (or root) of the mold. After you apply the product, most formulas require you to wait at least 15 minutes. During this period, the product is destroying mold spores at the roots while cleaning and disinfecting the treated surface. Most mold removers also work to prevent future mold growth by leaving behind an antimicrobial coating. </p><h3>Are mold removers safe? </h3><p>When used according to manufacturer directions, mold removers are safe for homeowner use. However, it’s important to take note of any directions for ventilation or personal protective equipment–like wearing a mask while using mold remover. You should also follow any directions to wear gloves to prevent skin irritation when applying the product.</p><h3>When should I call a professional?</h3><p>While all types of mold removal should be handled with appropriate safety measures, some <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/different-types-of-mold-4772562" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">types of mold</a>—particularly ‘black mold’ (known as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mold/stachy.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">Stachybotrys chartarum</a>)—may require professional remediation. This slimy green-black mold typically grows on porous materials like drywall, gypsum board, or wood.

<title>The 8 Best Teeth Whitening Products of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/fINLuaJ0zKsVhPpqbGuxxUY2_l0=/2120x1415/GettyImages-146276099-cecba04490e54cf0b92a3a454e3a8eb1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[White teeth can make a person appear younger, more awake, and more put-together. We researched the best products so that you can achieve a whiter smile.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're looking to get a brighter smile but don't want to splurge on professional whitening services, there are many over-the-counter options that can offer you comparable results at a lower price. From strips and LED trays to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-use-toothpaste-for-cleaning-4160076" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">toothpaste</a> and pens, we've researched the best products to whiten your teeth safely and effectively.</p><p>Read on for our top picks.</p><p>The Brilliant Complete Teeth Whitening System from GLO Science was developed by the celebrity dentist, Dr. Jonathan B. Levine, and it delivers impressive results. The kit includes a LED mouthpiece that connects to a controller, a USB power adapter, ten vials of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/hydrogen-peroxide-uses-home-4174809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">hydrogen peroxide</a> GLO whitening gel, a tube of lip balm, and a carrying case. The ten vials are supposed to be enough for 40 or more applications, and additional GLO whitening gel can be purchased separately.</p><p>After applying the lip balm to your lips and brushing the whitening gel onto your teeth, the LED mouthpiece goes in your mouth. The light activates through the connected controller, which then applies heat and light onto the front of your teeth. Once activated, the LED light will stay on for eight minutes. The teeth whitening system can be used up to four times a day and will typically offer noticeable results within a few days.</p><p>A few whitening sessions a day for at least five days in a row is recommended. And overuse shouldn’t be an issue since the kit was designed to eliminate sensitivity. While this system certainly isn’t the cheapest option on the market, it delivers professional-level results. If you’re looking for the best overall teeth whitening product, the GLO Science system is worth splurging on.</p><p>Today, many brands offer a version of teeth whitening strips, but Crest has been in the game the longest. Not surprisingly, the toothpaste manufacturer still makes the best strips. While there are a few tiers of Crest Whitestrips currently on the market, the 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips are the way to go.</p><p>Each box includes 20 individual packets of upper and lower strips, which are worn for a half-hour once a day. The no-slip strips stretch and mold to the shape of your teeth. With Crest’s Advanced Seal Technology, you can talk and even <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-water-testing-kits-4155794" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">drink water</a> while wearing them. And although the strips are notably grippy, they’re easy to remove and don’t leave a sticky residue. Although you can expect to see results within a few days, the full 20 days will provide dramatically whiter teeth.</p><p>Not all teeth are created equal, and neither should teeth whitening products. Those with darker, more set-in stains might want to opt for a stronger, more potent whitening formula, while those with sensitive teeth or lighter stains might prefer a gentler approach. And, of course, these needs could change over time—you might need a strong formula only at the beginning, and then rely on something lighter for upkeep.</p><p>Glowup is a great solution to these issues, providing LED teeth whitening kits that are tailored to both your short- and long-term needs. When ordering, you'll first take a survey asking you about your brushing habits, sensitivity, and so on. They'll then send you a customized kit with about a week's supply of whitening gels in either a light, medium, or strong formula.</p><p>To use, start by drying the front of your teeth, then apply the gel evenly over your teeth and insert the mouthpiece. The LED mouthpiece can be plugged into any smartphone, so it's convenient to use on the go or around your house. Each session lasts about 16 minutes—almost half the time of most whitening strips—and can lighten your teeth up to eight shades after a week of use.</p><p>At-home grooming treatments are becoming more and more high-tech, and as a result, many teeth whitening systems include <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/replacement-for-60-watt-incandescent-bulb-2175114" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">LED lights</a>. But the one that shines brighter than the rest is the Bright On Premium Teeth Whitening Kit from SmileDirectClub.</p><p>In addition to a hands-free LED accelerator light, this system comes with a six-month supply of whitening pens. Each pen is filled with an enamel-safe, dentist-approved gel formulated to be effective yet also suitable for even the most sensitive teeth. The LED tray can be plugged into your smartphone, so you can whiten your teeth anywhere you go. For best results, SmileDirect Club suggests daily ten-minute sessions for at least a week.</p><p>Whitening toothpaste is an excellent solution for those who want a bright, sparkly smile. If you already <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/electric-toothbrushes-to-buy-4117612" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">brush your teeth</a> twice a day, why not kill two birds with one stone and use a specially formulated whitening toothpaste, like Colgate Optic White Express? It contains hydrogen peroxide, which is the gold standard ingredient for bleaching teeth and is safe for ongoing daily use.</p><p>This toothpaste is not only practical but also fast when it comes to whitening teeth. According to Colgate, if you use it twice a day, you’ll have whiter teeth in as little as three days. That being said, you’ll see the best results with continuous use. Colgate Optic White Express also contains fluoride, so it’s the only toothpaste you’ll need to whiten your teeth and prevent cavities.</p><p>If you have reusable trays, all you need to whiten your teeth is a highly concentrated gel. Opalescence PF 35% Whitening Gel is the top choice of dentists and becoming quite popular among consumers. A pack includes eight syringes filled with mint-flavored carbamide peroxide, and each syringe contains enough gel for three to four applications. </p><p>Similar to other teeth whitening products, the Opalescence gel is intended to be applied for up to 30 minutes at a time. Since it contains 35 percent of the active ingredient, sessions longer than a half-hour aren’t recommended, especially for those with sensitive teeth.</p><p>If sensitivity has prevented you from whitening your teeth in the past, we recommend Lumineux Oral Essentials Whitening Strips. These strips are formulated without hydrogen peroxide, which is typically the culprit when it comes to pain and other sharp sensations.</p><p>Unlike many other whitening products, Lumineux Oral Essentials Whitening Strips remove stains with <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/using-coconut-oil-around-your-home-1103802" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">coconut oil</a>, sea salt, sage oil, lemon peel, and other naturally sourced ingredients. Not only are they gentle enough for sensitive teeth, but they’re also safe to use on veneers, crowns, and porcelain caps. Each box comes with 14 treatments, which can be applied up to three times a day for whiter teeth in just a week.</p><p>The ON THE GO Teeth Whitening Pen from Go Smile is convenient, compact, and affordable. This whitening pen has a sleek application brush that dispenses pre-filled gel as you twist it, which makes it easy to evenly coat your teeth. The mint-flavored gel is formulated to stick to your teeth better than other whitening pens—a necessary feature for a product that doesn’t have strips or trays to hold it in place.</p><p>Since it doesn’t need to be wiped off, the gel contains less hydrogen peroxide than most whitening serums. After applying the gel, wait at least 20 minutes before eating or drinking anything. Using the entire pen is recommended to achieve noticeably whiter teeth, so the results aren’t as quick as other whitening systems. However, the portability and affordability of this pen are what really make it stand out. Throw the Go Smile pen in your purse, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pack-toiletries-in-carry-on-bag-2648341" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">toiletry bag</a>, gym bag, car, or desk drawer to whiten your teeth anytime, anywhere.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and edited by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lily-sperry-5088244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily Sperry</a>, a lifestyle writer and commerce editor here at The Spruce.

<title>African Violets Shouldn&apos;t Be Throw-Away Plants—Here&apos;s How to Keep Them Alivethes</title>

<description><![CDATA[Grab these tips from houseplant pro Darryl Cheng, of House Plant Journal, on how to keep African violets alive and blooming all year long.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/YwSHMiTE_CJOKBSdWxbwQf2taIE=/2000x1500/GettyImages-1226618444-56cd1e7d482d4d4ba94543ef5921852a.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="African violets" width="2000" height="1500" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">Lola L. Falantes / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm an avid fan of African violets. When I first learned about them, I always assumed they were fussy plants that you only purchased for their lovely flowers. Once the flowers dropped, well, you just tossed them. In the past year, I learned they will flower profusely all year long when you provide them with all the appropriate conditions. What does it take to keep them alive and flowering? Houseplant expert Darryl Cheng, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Plant-Parent-Develop-House-Plant/dp/1419732390/" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"><em>The New Plant Parent</em></a> and creator of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/houseplantjournal/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">House Plant Journal</a>, shares his pro tips on how to keep your African violets looking great!</p><h2>It's All About the Light</h2><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/lighting-for-houseplants-1902691" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lighting</a> is the trickiest thing when it comes to growing African violets. They need bright light to bloom but do not tolerate hot, direct sun. How can you tell if your plants are getting enough or too much sunlight? If you notice the leaves are very dark green, and the stems are leggy, it's not getting enough light. If the leaves are light or have beached/white spots, it's getting too much.</p><p>"Don't judge your success with these plants based only on how much they bloom," says Cheng, "I derive joy from the overall plant, but if you want maximum blooms, the plant will need to be right on the windowsill of your largest, sunniest window - minimum two or three hours of direct sun."</p><p>Suppose you lack the proper natural light, no worries! "I personally don't have windows that give me two to three hours of direct sun," explains Cheng. "I use a powerful grow light kept at about one foot away for 14 hours a day." If using <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-grow-lights-4158720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow lights</a>, make sure you give the plants at least eight hours of darkness too. This helps them produce flowers.</p><h2>Water Them Correctly</h2><p>African violets prefer moderately moist soil. "You should watch for the soil to become almost halfway dry before thoroughly watering," says Cheng. "Avoid letting the soil become completely dry, but do not aim to keep the soil soaking wet at all times."</p><p>Make sure the water is at room temperature before you water the plants to avoid shocking the roots. Another tip is to allow tap water to sit overnight. This will ensure the chlorine evaporates and the water isn't too cold before you water. This method is also suitable for all your other houseplants.</p><p>Some enthusiasts recommend you should never get African violet's leaves wet. This is, in part, because the leaves are susceptible to rot if kept in high humidity. So, it's often advised to water the plants from the bottom to avoid getting excess water on the foliage. As long as use a slender spout watering can to water directly in the soil and the plant has excellent air circulation, the leaves will be fine. </p><h2>Feed Them</h2><p>All plants need food to thrive, and fertilizing your African violets will help them flower. Cheng says that <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-npk-mean-for-a-fertilizer-2131094" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">using a fertilizer with a higher phosphorus</a> (P) generally encourages flowering.</p><p>"Fertilizer ratios are listed as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. A higher P fertilizer will have numbers in the ratio 1-2-1 or even 1-3-1, for example, or 8-14-9," explains Cheng. "Notice the ratios don't have to be exact." As long as the middle number is the highest, that will indicate the fertilizer has a higher phosphorus level.</p><p>You can also use a specially formulated liquid African violet fertilizer at one-quarter strength every time you water or at full strength every two weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Don't go overboard—over-fertilizing is a more common problem than under-fertilizing.</p><h2>Repot Correctly</h2><p>African violets like it snug when it comes to pot size. The pot should only be about one-third to half the diameter of the plant. For example, if your plant is about seven to nine inches wide, the pot only needs to be three inches wide. The proper pot size will promote blooming. Don't go too deep, either. Shallower pots are better for drainage and root aeration.</p><p>Finally, only repot the plant in fresh soil once a year and use an African violet potting mix or a well-draining all-purpose potting soil.</p><h2>Appreciate the Foilage</h2><p>Even if you can not get your plants to reflower, they make exciting foliage plants. "African violets are interesting plants not just for their flowers," says Cheng, "Their leaves form a beautiful rosette pattern and can be propagated. With excellent light, a whole new plant can develop from one leaf." Keep the foliage looking great by dusting periodically with a small, soft brush.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>How to Grow Hydrangeas</title>

<description><![CDATA[Hydrangeas (Hydrangea spp.) are usually easy to grow. With myriad varieties and colors of blooms, these shrubs are popular landscaping options.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/zOuaQP6ZeCjtgyjj-AFlc_fepmA=/1500x1001/growing-hydrangeas-1402684-01-d22f3e7d2e594e3b9731a2c33e70e328.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="closeup of a pink hydrangea" width="1500" height="1001" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Claire Cohen Bates</span></figcaption></figure><p>With dozens of species and even more varieties, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/identifying-old-fashioned-hydrangea-1402687" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">hydrangeas</a> (<em>Hydrangea spp.</em>) have been popular garden plants for decades. Their flowers now come in a wide array of colors, including bright blue, deep red, and pale green. Some hydrangeas have large, round flower clusters while others have smaller, flatter, and more delicate flowers. The foliage also varies depending on the species. Plus, these versatile shrubs thrive in sandy coastal soils, shady woodland sites, and almost everything in between. To ensure that hydrangea shrubs have time to establish a healthy root system before blooming, it is best to plant them in fall or early spring. Once planted, hydrangeas are rapid growers, averaging 2 feet or more of growth per year.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Dyp3YgbCo-nXibuFVneDIovP1qo=/1500x1001/growing-hydrangeas-1402684-03-e11232b1f467492f8f8f053c01786cb7.jpg" alt="blue hydrangeas" width="1500" height="1001" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">​The Spruce / Claire Cohen Bates</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/txVEcAKU7CIhT5OTKKkCqJVtwZ8=/5267x3516/summer-blooming-oakleaf-hydrangeas-2132724-09-128eb6d70f844a0c8f8eb984bea6c6d7.jpg" alt="oakleaf hydrangeas" width="5267" height="3516" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Adrienne Legault</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/I2SgbI9TNwAdfD1Loj_Fm9EYpHI=/1500x1001/growing-hydrangeas-1402684-04-5ffb78bb30e0442a8542f982f30ef749.jpg" alt="bright blue hydrangeas" width="1500" height="1001" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">​The Spruce / Claire Cohen Bates</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Hydrangea Care</h2><p>Most hydrangeas can adapt to a wide range of growing conditions. They are generally hardy from <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/maps-for-growing-zones-from-the-usda-2132409" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">USDA growing zones</a> 5 to 9. And as long as they are planted in well-draining soil with plenty of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-organic-matter-1401911" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">organic matter</a>, they should grow well.</p><p>Plan to water your hydrangeas regularly, especially in hot and dry weather. And fertilize them once a year. You also might need to do some pruning each year, but it shouldn’t be excessive. </p><h3>Light</h3><p>Too much shade can reduce a hydrangea shrub's flower output. Hydrangeas do well in the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-full-sun-partial-shade-1402372" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">partial shade</a> provided by tall deciduous trees, especially if they receive morning sun and the partial shade is in the heat of the afternoon. They will also thrive in full sun but might need extra water on hot summer days.</p><h3>Soil</h3><p>In general, hydrangeas can tolerate a wide range of soil types. One of the perks of growing hydrangeas is being able to change their flower color. Although somewhat determined by cultivar, the color can be tweaked by the amount of aluminum in the soil and the soil pH. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soil-ph-1402462" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">soil pH</a> determines how available aluminum is to the plants. Acidic soil (aluminum available to the plants) will give you blue flowers, and alkaline soil (aluminum unavailable to the plants) will give you pink flowers.</p><p>To decrease the acidity of your soil and change flowers from blue to pink, add hydrated lime to the soil in the spring. To increase the acidity to change flowers from pink to blue, add aluminum sulfate to your soil in the spring, or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/mulch-types-for-flowerbeds-1315846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">mulch</a> with oak-leaf mulch.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>Hydrangeas prefer a deep watering at least once a week unless you've had rainfall. During particularly hot weather, slightly increase the amount of water you give your plants, but make sure they're not sitting in soggy soil.</p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><p>Hydrangeas prefer fairly mild temperatures. In areas with bitterly cold winters, dieback (a plant dying from the tips of its leaves inward) can be a problem. Protect your hydrangeas from cold winds by planting them in a sheltered spot or with a burlap windscreen or burlap frame filled with dry leaves. A north- or east-facing site, where temperatures remain somewhat constant, is a better choice than a spot on the south and west side of your property, which will heat up in the winter sun and can cause buds to open prematurely and be vulnerable to cold snaps. Furthermore, hydrangeas prefer moderate to high humidity, as dry climates can cause the leaves to wilt.</p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><p>If your soil is rich in nutrients, you likely won't have to fertilize your hydrangeas. In fact, if hydrangeas are given too much <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-npk-mean-for-a-fertilizer-2131094" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">high-nitrogen fertilizer</a>, they might grow full and lush but with fewer flowers. If your soil is not rich, apply a flowering shrub fertilizer in the spring.</p><h2>Are Hydrangeas Toxic?</h2><p>Hydrangeas contain cyanogenic glycosides, which are toxic both to people and animals when ingested. The leaves, buds, and flowers have higher concentrations of this compound. </p><h3>Symptoms of Poisoning</h3><p>Symptoms of toxicity in both people and animals include nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and lethargy. If you suspecting poisoning, contact a medical professional as soon as possible.</p><h2>Hydrangea Varieties</h2><p>There are two main groups of hydrangeas: plants that bloom on new growth (the current year's stems) and those that bloom on old growth (last year's stems). Some <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/top-hydrangea-varieties-4129245" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">varieties</a> include:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Hydrangea macrophylla</em>: </strong>Also known as bigleaf hydrangea, this species grows to around 6 to 10 feet tall and wide and has leaves that reach around 6 inches long.</li><li><strong><em>Hydrangea arborescens</em>: </strong>Known as smooth hydrangea, this shrub reaches around 3 to 5 feet tall and wide and produces white to pink flowers. </li><li><strong><em>Hydrangea quercifolia</em>: </strong>Commonly called oakleaf hydrangeas, this plant reaches around 7 feet tall and wide and sports white to purplish-pink flowers. </li></ul><h2>Pruning Hydrangeas</h2><p>Hydrangeas typically need minimal <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/when-to-prune-hydrangeas-1403320" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">pruning</a>. But if you would like to reduce the size of your plant or prevent it from flopping over too much, you can remove some of the older canes after the flowers fade. This will reduce crowding and encourage new growth.</p><p>The exception to this rule is when cold winters kill the tips of the branches. Then, you should prune in the spring, removing the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-recognize-dead-wood-3269556" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">dead wood</a> and cutting back the stems to a healthy set of buds. If you have an established shrub, you can also take out several of the older stems at this time. Just don't remove all the buds, or you will lose your blooms for that season.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After taking the time to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-landscaping-shrubs-4138292" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">select the best shrubs</a>, prepare <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/planting-flower-beds-2132568" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">flower beds</a>, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-deeply-should-seeds-be-planted-2539711" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">plant seeds</a> in your garden, adding mulch can really take it to the next level.</p><p>You should consider the areas that you plan to cover when selecting your mulch, as well as any family members or pets that will be in close contact with the new addition to your landscaping. Certain mulch products are toxic to pets, while others break down quickly. Some mulch options last for multiple years, but some need to be replaced frequently as they are worked into the soil.</p><p>Here are the best mulch options for your lawn and garden.</p><p>This all-natural hardwood mulch is the perfect balance of value, use, and quality. It is a vibrant brown color naturally through an aging process that doesn’t add any chemicals or dyes. This results in a natural color that won’t fade over time. It is also a finely shredded mulch, resulting in fewer large pieces that can wash away or get into your grass.</p><p>For those who prefer a more striking colorized option, Texas Native mulch does come in a black dyed option. The dye is approved by the EPA, environmentally safe, and non-toxic. Either option makes an attractive addition to your garden, yard, or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/landscaping-4127779" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">landscaping</a>.</p><p>This budget-friendly option comes in a bag that contains two cubic feet of mulch, which is approximately 56.6. liters, and you can choose from three different colors (black, brown, or red). One bag will cover eight square feet when placed three inches deep. This means that a small investment can really go a long way in large areas that need to be covered with mulch. </p><p>It does break down and fade faster than some of its competitors, but if you are looking to upgrade your outdoor space without spending a lot of money, Vigoro mulches will deliver a big bang for your buck. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/natural-vs-colored-mulch-2131981" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Colorized mulch</a> does fade over time so to maintain the most vibrant looks, you should plan to replace it at least once per season. Keeping water off of the mulch for at least 24 hours after application can help with color retention.</p><p>For a long-lasting mulch that will not fade or deteriorate, rubber mulch is the way to go. NuScape brown mulch has the same look as other wood-based mulches but is heavier, more durable, and made of 100 percent recycled rubber. It also provides a bit of bounce, making it a great option for playgrounds or swing sets.</p><p>Rubber mulch tends to be more expensive than its all-natural competitors but lasts for much longer. If you want to put down mulch once and enjoy it for years, the NuScape rubber mulch is a product you will love. Just be ready to invest upfront in its higher cost.</p><p>Mulch can do wonders to keep weeds at bay in your vegetable garden. It’s important when mulching a vegetable garden to choose a product that is easy to maintain and isn’t too expensive, as you will be turning over your garden at the end of the season.</p><p>Long Leaf Pine Straw is a great option because it is inexpensive and allows water to pass through easily to get to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/starting-a-vegetable-garden-1403411" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">your vegetables.</a> You may still get some weeds that pop through, but these can be easily removed by hand when needed. It tends to have fewer potential seeds than similar options, like straw or hay.</p><p>Compost is a great way to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/mulch-types-for-flowerbeds-1315846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">mulch flower beds</a> since it provides nutrients to the soil and looks neat and attractive as well. This organic option is made with cow manure, alfalfa meal, and pure earthworm castings. Like any mulch, compost helps soil retain moisture and regulate temperature. It also has the added benefit of nutrients for the plants, often resulting in larger, more colorful, more plentiful, and longer-lasting flowers.</p><p>If you’re looking for a black mulch that will keep its vibrant shade for a full year, Earthgro by Scotts is a great product. It works just as any other mulch does by locking in moisture, blocking weeds from getting sunlight, and regulating the temperature of the soil underneath.</p><p>This mulch is also available in brown and red. For the longest-lasting color, you should make sure that the mulch is dry for at least 24 hours after applying it to your yard. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/natural-vs-colored-mulch-2131981" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Colored mulch</a> does need to be replaced at the end of the season or more often, depending on how much sun it receives. Harsh sun or extreme weather can cause the color to fade faster.</p><p>One of the most important factors when adding anything directly to your lawn is to choose a product that will improve the soil as well as protect it. This is especially true if you are applying it to an area where grass struggles to grow. Scotts Topsoil is a mixture of organic soil and peat moss, which helps build strong roots to your existing grass.</p><p>This is a great option to fill in holes or improve bare patches in your lawn. For those beginning a new garden, Scotts Topsoil is the perfect addition to spruce up the area before and during planting. Keep in mind that this topsoil is designed to be used in-ground rather than in containers or raised beds. It does not prohibit the growth of weeds in garden beds.</p><p>For contained use, such as in a raised bed, this weed barrier cloth will keep only your desired plants growing strong. You can add another mulch on top if you prefer, providing both weed protection and the attractive clean look of mulch. A mulch barrier works great in an area where you really want to keep weeds at bay.</p><p>This mulch acts as a physical barrier between potential weeds growing in the soil and your beautiful garden. You will need to cut spots for your desired plants to grow. Rainwater has a hard time permeating the paper, though, so additional water is necessary to keep your plants healthy and growing. Unlike its plastic counterparts, this biodegradable option breaks down over time and adds nutrients to your soil.</p><p>This mulch is made with bark from sustainable pine forests and replicates the look of your house plant and outdoor potted plant soils, just a little bit nicer. These chips are small but more consistent in size and shape than most shredded mulch products. This provides a cohesive look to potted plants, which many plant growers enjoy.</p><p>Mulch in potted plants can help keep moisture in and provide shade and protection to the tender roots growing just under the surface. While a bit more expensive than some other mulch options, the Organic Houseplant Mulch is a great option for small-scale use.</p><p>After applying grass seed, following up with the GreenView Fairway Formula Seed Success Biodegradable Mulch will protect them as they grow. This paper mulch/fertilizer combo keeps water in, regulates temperature, and stays put thanks to the included tackifier. The fertilizer encourages grass growth in the areas where you apply.</p><p>You will need to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-grass-seed-4174720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">purchase grass seed separately</a>, which allows you to customize the application to match your existing lawn. All you need to do is water occasionally to keep the mulch in place. As your grass grows, the pellets break down naturally, leaving you with nothing but a lush lawn.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Mulch</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>There are two main types of mulch: organic and inorganic. Organic mulch includes anything that is made from a natural material, such as wood, paper, straw, grass clippings, or compost, that will decompose over time. It does not necessarily mean that the material is free of pesticides or chemicals, although some compost may be. Inorganic mulch includes anything made from synthetic materials, such as rubber mulch or plastic weed cloth.</p><h3>Use</h3><p>Mulch is used to create a barrier between the soil underneath and the environment. This can help regulate the temperature of the soil and retain moisture, both beneficial to the roots of plants growing in the mulch. It can also prevent weeds from sprouting, as they do not get sufficient sunlight to germinate and grow.</p><h3>Pet Safety</h3><p>Not all mulch products are safe for pets. Cocoa shells as mulch, also known as cocoa bean mulch, is toxic to dogs because it contains caffeine and theobromine, two compounds that can make your dog very sick. If you are a pet owner, it’s best to steer clear of these types of mulch completely. Instead, look for a natural alternative that is pet-safe.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What is mulch?</h3><p>Mulch is <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-mulch-1402413" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">any material that is used to cover the soil</a>, either with a particular purpose or just to beautify the space. Mulch benefits a garden by retaining moisture, regulating temperature, and suppressing weeds. Depending on the material, it can also decompose and add essential nutrients to the soil.</p><p>Mulch can be made from natural materials, such as wood, straw, clippings, compost, or even paper. Called organic mulch, this type of mulch can help the soil quality as well as look great in your garden. You should make sure that your organic mulch does not include seeds that will sprout and work against your hard work.</p><p>Inorganic mulch includes types that are made of synthetic materials, such as rubber pellets or plastic weed sheets. This type of mulch is often more expensive to set up but can last for a long time and look great. It also does not break down over time. This can be a pro or a con, depending on your reason for laying mulch.</p><h3>When is the best time to mulch?</h3><p>The top mulch time is mid Spring after the soil has started to warm and before the weeds start rearing their little buds. If you mulch too early, it will prevent the soil from warming and make it harder for your garden to grow in late Spring and Summer. Waiting too long to mulch will mean that you have extra work to do to clear out any weeds that have already started to grow.</p><p>Fall is another great time to mulch your garden, especially if you are using organic mulch to improve your soil quality. Mulching in the fall insulates your soil during the colder winter months. Some plants need the cold weather to go dormant, so waiting until the first frost can be a great way to both support your plants and have time to get the mulch down before the cold days and nights of winter.</p><h3>Can you use old mulch?</h3><p>Organic mulch is made to break down and provide additional nutrients to the soil as it decomposes. This means that <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-to-do-with-old-mulch-in-spring-2130854" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">as your mulch ages</a>, it may not function very well as a mulch. If you scoop up a handful of mulch and it looks and feels more like soil, it is time to replace the mulch. Simply work it into the soil to add nutrients and replace it with a new layer.</p><p>If the mulch still provides cover, you can reuse it for another season. Rake it to one side as you tend to the soil underneath. This is especially important in vegetable, herb, and fruit gardens where you plan to grow plants to eat. Test your soil, add any nutrients it needs, then rake the mulch back over to cover.</p><p>The one exception to this is when your plants or garden experienced disease that you think is tied to the mulch. In this case, you should remove and dispose of the mulch safely. You will need to add a new layer of mulch to cover your soil before the growing season begins.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/katie-begley-4693290" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Katie Begley,</a> who has used mulch to spruce up her yard and benefit her garden in California, Hawaii, Virginia, and North Carolina.

This type of freezer certainly is a game-changer, as it can be set up in your kitchen—where you can easily access your chicken and sweet potato fries at dinner time—or in your garage. They come with double doors or in extra-large capacities, so you can easily peruse what you have and not buy the same item twice at the grocery store.</p><p>Upright freezers are in the business of being reliable and practical like your home appliances should be. However, they take it to the next level by delivering space and even the ability to keep your goods frozen for multiple days in the event of a power outage.</p><p>Below, the best upright freezers on the market:</p><p>This pick from Frigidaire gives you plenty of room to store everything you need, and makes sure it stays frozen solid, thanks to the brand's EvenTemp Cooling System. This technology circulates air to prevent warm spots from forming and ultimately spoiling your food. It's one of many features this upright freezer has that makes it the best option to shop, hands-down.</p><p>In addition to the cooling technology, this model also can keep your food frozen for up to two days in the event of a power outage and be installed in a garage. It can withstand temperatures from 0 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and even sports a reversible door so you can shimmy it into any spot that's most convenient for you. A design that's both thoughtful and accessible continues within the 15.5-cubic-foot interior, that's outfitted with four shelves and a sliding storage basket. For any items that don't easily stack on shelves, or you'd like to be able to reach for quickly (like a container of ice cream), there are five spacious door bins as well.</p><p>Other helpful features include an alarm that sounds if the door is left open, a light at the bottom that tells you at a glance if the freezer is working properly, and LED interior lights so you can see what you're looking for. All in all, this upright freezer checks off all the boxes and would be a great buy for any household.</p><p>Don’t burn up cash shopping for an ice-cold appliance. Instead, save money with this budget-friendly freezer from Maytag. It'll treat you to high-end amenities such as interior LED lighting, an automatic defroster, and a fairly large capacity of 15.7 cubic feet. It skips out on a stylish, stainless steel finish, but definitely provides a lot of bang for your buck otherwise.</p><p>With its FastFreeze feature, you're able to freeze a large amount of goods very quickly so that they don't lose any of their original, store-bought freshness. This feature typically lasts for 24 hours, before the freezer goes back to its automatic cycle. For those who like to <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-freeze-plums-2216929" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">freeze fruit</a> for smoothies or <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-meat-and-fish-to-freeze-according-to-butchers-4802681" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">freeze meat</a>, this feature will make a big impact and ensure that every meal with flavor. If you're someone who's looking for an upright freezer for extra storage purposes, this model also comes with three adjustable shelves and a built-in storage gate that turns the freezer floor into usable space.</p><p>For a model with a average amount of capacity and a reversible door as well, this piece is sort of a hidden gem. It may use up the same amount of energy as an upright freezer with slightly more space, but will save you money the day you purchase it without a doubt.</p><p>For the maximum in upright freezer storage space, turn to this very large option from GE. It's impressive in size, measuring 6 feet and 3 inches tall, and packing in just over 21 cubic feet of space. In comparison, most upright freezers top out at about 20 cubic feet. GE squeezed in an extra 1.3 cubic feet for you to stash a few more steaks or frozen dinners.</p><p>This model of upright freezer from GE has four wire shelves and one wire basket to keep things sorted and visible. In addition, four door shelves keep any smaller items in plain sight. Now, the super strong seal of this model may make the door a little tough to open. However, this seal will ensure that no cold air escapes the interior, stabilizing the environment your food is in.</p><p>Of course, such a large capacity upright freezer might not fit well in your kitchen, or you may not want to haul this heavy-duty model down to the basement. If you plan to keep it in your garage, know that it will perform well in temperatures from 0 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the manufacturer. This is also a frost-free unit at a quality price, so you won’t need to worry about thawing and draining this mammoth appliance.</p><p>It's quite possible that you don't need a ton of extra freezer space, and are looking for a more compact pick like the Magic Chef MCUF3W2. This upright freezer has just 3.0 cubic feet of storage space, which is ideal for smaller households, apartments, or RVs. Although it does require you to manually defrost it from time to time, it has two wire shelves for organizing easy-to-make meals, meats, fruits, or vegetables. In addition, its reversible door with a recessed handle makes it a flexible option that can be installed just about anywhere.</p><p>You can pair it with a matching mini refrigerator to complete an on-the-go kitchen, or set it up in a basement where you're putting together an at-home bar. Once you install it, just use the manual controls to adjust the interior's temperature anywhere between -4 and 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This range is much narrower than other models' on the market, but you'll likely find it meets your needs.</p><p>Do you keep your upright freezer in the garage? If so, consider this model that is built to be durable and portable, making it the perfect choice for an appliance that will be stored in flexible temperatures.</p><p>The Gladiator GAFZ30FDGB features a black matte finish and a unique step-to-open door. It's super convenient to open up the unit using the stainless steel foot pedal when you have arms full of groceries ready to be stocked inside. Adding to the functionality of this garage-ready upright freezer is how it sits on four, heavy-duty caster wheels. Reposition the freezer easily if you need to use the space for other storage needs or a special project.</p><p>On the inside, you’ll find heavy-gauge wire shelves and baskets, with adjustable positions to store and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-organize-a-freezer-5085778" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">sort frozen goods</a>. Door shelves and bins keep tiny goods within easy reach. All in all, there's 17.8 cubic feet of space of food storage. And while this model isn't compatible with an ice maker kit, it does keep your food chilled at the right temperature thanks to electronic controls.</p><p>If you don’t quite trust the natural, automatic defrosting cycles of a freezer, then consider this small Danby model that has <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/self-defrost-or-manual-defrost-freezer-1907755" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">manual defrost</a>. It has a mechanical thermostat that can be set anywhere from -11 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. When it comes time to manually defrost this piece, you'll want to pull everything out so you can scrape any thick ice chunks off the interior and cooling elements.</p><p>This is quite a tedious task, but luckily this particular model isn't too large. With an 5.9-cubic-foot capacity, it has just enough space to store anything extra that wouldn't fit in your main freezer, but won't overwhelm you on cleaning day. You can organize your frozen food using five shelves that quickly attract cold air. Once you close its reversible door, you can be happy with the fact that it runs quietly and remains reliable.</p><p>Although this model may not have every single bell and whistle, it certainly will get the job done and fill your needs. It's slightly more cost-effective because of the smaller capacity, but also because it runs on about half the energy of other upright freezer models, at 256 kWh compared to nearly 500 kWh per year.</p><p>An upright freezer doesn't have to be <em>just</em> a freezer. The Samsung RZ11M7074SA proves it, as it can be set as either a single freezer or refrigerator compartment. To get started with this convertible model, just <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/freezer-installation-steps-1907757" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">hook it up</a> after it's delivered to your home, and set the interior temperature between -8 and 44 degrees Fahrenheit. Ideally, you'd want to set the temperature around 0 degrees if you want to store frozen food inside, and 36 degrees if you want to store fresh items like produce, dinner leftovers, or drinks.</p><p>A power freeze option allows you to reach those prime, chilly temperatures as quickly as possible. This puts a little more power behind the fan, so the model can circulate the coldest air for up to 50 hours. Despite this high-functioning element of design, the appliance is still Energy Star-certified, and won't rack up your bills in the name of extra storage. Not to mention, this upright freezer has a reversible door, bulk storage baskets, a frost-free design that ensures you don't need to manually defrost it, and a power indicator. It may not be the most spacious option on the market, but is ultimately convenient, versatile, and reliable.</p><p>This upright freezer does a lot to make it easy for you to store and access food in whatever way is best for you. It offers almost 18 cubic feet of space to store your grocery store goods, and prioritizes accessibility with bright, LED lighting and five door bins. You can use these bins to store smaller items such as a pack of butter or pre-made smoothie, so that they don't get lost in the back.</p><p>In addition to those five door bins, this model also has one bulk storage basket and four shelves that'll help keep you organized and stress-free. If you typically worry about your items getting too frozen, you'll also love the interior electronic temperature controls in this model that let you tailor your experience, as well as its frost-free design. This takes away the need to manually defrost your freezer, which can be time-consuming and annoying.</p><p>Overall, this upright freezer doesn't shy away from style or functionality. With a stainless steel exterior, it'll fit in well with your other kitchen appliances or could even be placed beside its matching refrigerator.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Upright Freezer</h2><h3>Capacity</h3><p>The interior of an upright freezer is measured in cubic feet. It can range from as little as 3.0 cubic feet, to nearly 22 cubic feet. The larger the capacity of your model, the more you can store, so you'll need to consider how much you want to store before buying. The average upright freezer has around 16 cubic feet of space, and is divided up with four or five shelves, as well as a basket. To put this in perspective, that's enough space to store 560 pounds of meat.</p><h3>Manual vs. automatic defrosting</h3><p>Upright freezers either manually or automatically defrost. If a freezer manually defrosts, that means that ice and frost will build up in the interior over time. To maintain the model and ensure the cold air can flow evenly, you must unplug the model, remove everything from inside, and give the frost some time to melt away. You can speed up the process by chipping away at the frost build-up, before then draining the water, and plugging in your appliance. Automatic defrosting eliminates this routine, and allows the model to regulate itself. This type of freezer is also known as frost-free or self-defrosting, and can make your experience much easier, but will cost more to operate and purchase upfront.</p><h3>Temperature range</h3><p>The temperature range of an upright freezer will determine what you can store inside of it. In most models, this range goes from -10 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, which is ideal for storing meats, fruit, or baked goods for long periods of time. Compact or budget models typically have a smaller range, and only allow for the internal temperature to be set between -4 and 7 degrees, while convertible models can be set as high as 44 degrees. To find the right fit for you, consider what you're storing, and know that the internal temperature range is separate from the exterior temperatures your upright freezer can withstand.</p><h2>Standout Features</h2><h3>Garage-ready design</h3><p>If an upright freezer is garage-ready, it can be used in an outdoor setting where temperatures can be very flexible. Despite a very hot or cold external environment, the unit will run reliably and effectively. A garage-ready model is most suitable for households who don't want to eliminate space inside their home for more frozen food storage, or want their appliance to have several installation options.</p><h3>Quick freeze setting</h3><p>When you turn on your upright freezer for the first time, or add new items to it after going to the store, a quick freeze setting will help the internal environment get cold fast. When activated, it'll override the temperature you set, and circulate the coldest air possible. It will continue for up to 50 hours—packing in the flavors of your meats, fruits, and vegetables. This is useful for households who want an entirely hands-free experience, or are interested in a convertible model.</p><h3>Reversible door</h3><p>An upright freezer with a reversible door can be opened by swinging the door to the left or right. This is a convenient feature if you plan on installing your freezer in a tight space or cluttered garage. You'll notice that this type of door features recessed handles and airtight seals. The seals can become worn over time, but be replaced if needed.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I set the temperature on an upright freezer?</h3><p>To set the temperature on an upright freezer, first locate the temperature controls. The controls could be a manual dial, which you turn to your desired setting, or an electronic panel, where you tap buttons until the readout shows the proper internal temperature. To properly store frozen food, you should set the internal temperature to 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Some upright freezers have a warm temperature or door alarm that'll notify you if the interior gets warmer than that.</p><h3>How do you organize an upright freezer?</h3><p>When organizing an upright freezer, or any freezer, you want to keep one rule in mind: first in, first out. In doing so, you won't forget about certain packaged meats, and inevitably throw them away after you find them months later. Another tip to follow includes putting your fruit, frozen meals, or vegetables in their own designated storage bins. In addition, plan to store bread and butter in the door bins, as it's a bit warmer.

It has a smaller footprint, leaving space for other items in your home. Upright freezers are also easier to organize— since shelving and door bins provide many thoughtful organization options. In contrast, chest freezers use less energy, and are less noisy. This is essential if you want to save money or are planning on installing the unit in your home.

<description><![CDATA[A bottom freezer refrigerator can make it easy to see the food you&#39;re storing. We researched the top picks for every household and budget.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you come home from the store with bags of fresh produce, deli meat, and ice cream, the last thing you want to worry about is where to put it all. For most families, a bottom freezer refrigerator puts your most used items right at eye level, and provides plenty of room for your frozen goods, like veggies, frozen meals, and—of course—ice cream.</p><p>It's possible that you need a counter-depth model for when you're living in an RV, or need a bit more room than the average household, and we've got you covered on all accounts.</p><p>Here, the best bottom freezer refrigerators for every lifestyle, budget, and specific need.</p><p>For a well-designed and functional bottom freezer refrigerator, look no further than the Whirlpool WRB322DMBM. This appliance has it all, from a sleek and simple exterior that'll be easy to match in your kitchen, to a temperature control system that'll bring your groceries to their ideal temperature without wasting a boatload of energy. It will work to keep your produce fresher for longer as well, using its FreshFlow technology, which absorbs any excess gas that would make your food spoil. Ultimately, that technology will help you save money, too.</p><p>Given its price point, the WRB322DMBM also offers a generous amount of space for your groceries. Its total capacity is 22 cubic feet, with almost 16 cubic feet of that space in the refrigerator portion. The five shelves in the fridge allow you to keep your goods organized, and the freezer has sliding baskets for bulky items that'll allow you to access even the most tucked away bag of frozen chicken.</p><p>All in all, this bottom freezer refrigerator gets you the most bang for your buck, and has many notable features that'll help you overlook oversights, like the fact that it has no butter keeper.</p><p>For a bottom freezer fridge at a bottom dollar price, it’s hard to beat the value of the Amana ABB1921BRW. This appliance offers the conveniences of a bottom freezer configuration without a price tag that'll melt your bank account. Available in white or black finishes—or shiny stainless steel for a small upgrade charge—you can add this compact but efficient fridge to your kitchen with total ease.</p><p>While there aren’t a lot of fancy features on this model, it covers all the bases. In the easy-to-access fridge, you’ll find gallon-size door bins to fit milk or juice, and humidity-controlled produce bins. The control panel is front and center, making it easy to adjust settings, and maintain <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-save-money-on-refrigeration-2941167" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimal fridge and freezer temperatures</a>. In the freezer below, you’ll find wire shelving, a pull-out basket, and in-door shelving to keep everything neat and organized. You really can’t go wrong with the Amana if you need a budget bottom freezer refrigerator.</p><p>If your budget allows you to add a bottom freezer refrigerator to your space that's more expensive, then the KitchenAid KRFF507HBS is a sleek choice. It features a black stainless steel exterior, paired with slim, stainless steel handles. This combination, in addition to an external ice and water dispenser, will give any kitchen a gourmet look and feel.</p><p>When entertaining, you'll likely receive positive comments from guests, and enjoy the spacious interior that is perfect for storing many side dishes at once. With a 27-cubic-foot interior, this fridge definitely doesn't skimp out on space. The refrigerator uses around 19 cubic feet of this space, and includes five glass shelves, two produce crispers, and a pizza box slot for putting away leftovers easily and properly. The freezer, on the other hand, uses just under 8 cubic feet of space, and has both tiers and dividers that'll make organizing your long-lasting items a total breeze.</p><p>One issue you may run into with this fridge is that the ice maker may leak, or have ice build-up around it. The model may also run a bit noisy. Otherwise, this fridge will be a great, high-end addition to your home.</p><p>For a counter-depth bottom freezer refrigerator, the GE GLE12HSPSS is a great option. This slim refrigerator has an eye-catching, stainless steel finish and offers 11.9 cubic feet of total space. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/counter-depth-refrigerator-overview-1908659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">counter-depth design</a> means it will sit flush with your countertops, making your kitchen appear very high-end.</p><p>But, where this appliance is stylish, it's also quite functional. The refrigerator has a total of seven shelves for organizing your fresh food. A temperature-controlled drawer separates the fridge and freezer portions, and is the perfect spot to store easy-to-reach snacks or drinks. A bottle storage rack can even store your <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/wine-bottle-sizes-3511310" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">bottles of wine</a>, eliminating the need for a separate wine cooler. Most notably, the freezer features a removable tray so you can maximize this section, and make sure your most-used items are right on top. With a lower-than-normal price tag, it's really a pick that's hard to beat, assuming you don't want a water and ice dispenser.</p><p>This LG Electronics model maximizes your refrigerator and freezer space, but doesn't make compromises in the process. It still comes with modern amenities such as easy-to-clean shelves, LED lighting, and an ice maker. The 8.3 cubic feet of frozen food storage may be the most notable part of this appliance though, as it'll hold any tubs of ice cream, wrapped-up meats, or frozen vegetables with ease. You can organize everything in the two provided baskets, and make use of a deli drawer and gallon door storage in the refrigerator portion as well.</p><p>The modern technology of this appliance ensures that no matter how much you pack it with grocery store goods, everything remains at its ideal temperature. The <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/self-defrost-or-manual-defrost-freezer-1907755" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic defroster</a>, for example, reduces the amount of frost build-up. Electronic temperature controls also give the appliance more control over the environment it creates.</p><p>Although the fingerprint-proof, stainless steel exterior may not stop a child from leaving their mark on this fridge, any prints will easy wipe off and this purchase will ultimately be a win.</p><p>Do you prefer a French door refrigerator? If so, the Whirlpool WRF535SWHZ is a great choice that’s big on size and style.</p><p>This French door refrigerator with a bottom freezer offers 25 cubic feet of space inside and a fingerprint-resistant, stainless steel finish outside. The sides of the fridge are a textured gray, which is typical for most stainless-steel fridges. Some well-loved features on this refrigerator include the interior water dispenser and in-freezer ice maker. Typically, a water dispenser can be a difficult feature to find on a bottom freezer fridge. However, the French door design of this Whirlpool model makes it possible.</p><p>Now, the 7.4 cubic feet of freezer space isn’t quite as large as some other bottom freezer fridges. But, any household will likely find it to be big enough. The drawer in the freezer is a solid bin instead of a wire basket, too, so small items won't slip through. If you have the space to install a piece with wide-swinging doors, a mid-priced and full-featured model from Whirlpool is certainly a quality choice.</p><p>When you are looking for the most versatility and convenience in a refrigerator, the Samsung RF23J9011SR is hard to beat. This refrigerator features a set of French doors on top and a freezer on the bottom. However, the freezer is split into two separate compartments. You can turn one into a refrigerated section if you need more storage for fresh foods. Then, if your frozen food stash starts to get bigger, you can simply set the compartment <em>back</em> to freezer mode.</p><p>Ultimately, the Samsung 4-Door Flex is the perfect refrigerator for a household that doesn't need a lot of bottom freezer space, or wants their experience to be both flexible and reliable. The only catch with this refrigerator is the circulation mode can be a little noisy. However, once you get used to it, the possibilities of this refrigerator prove to be super practical and worth the cost of the model.</p><p>Being able to open up your refrigerator and pour yourself a glass of water is a luxury this Haier appliance understands. It has an internal water dispenser, as well as an ice maker which comes already installed in the model. When having your piece delivered and set up, you will want to make sure a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ice-maker-refrigerator-water-line-2718666" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">water connection kit</a> is included. You should plan to either have someone hook it up for you or to hook it up yourself. Once you have it set up, you can expect ice to be made quickly and regularly.</p><p>The biggest selling point on this freezer, other than the dispenser, may be how spacious it is. With 27 cubic feet of space and five refrigerator shelves, you can easily keep your produce and fresh goods organized. Each shelf is adjustable, which makes it easy to customize your fridge's layout. In addition, the bins of this model are slightly blue-tinted and the interior has bright, LED lighting, so you'll feel as cool as a cucumber when locating a snack.</p><p>Now for the downsides: The freezer may not be as customizable or spacious as the fridge section. This appliance is also significantly wider and taller than others on the market, so you'll want to measure your space ahead of time.</p><p>Overall, it's a great pick, for those looking for a functional and luxurious fridge that's able to provide well-filtered water on demand.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Bottom Freezer Refrigerator</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>A bottom freezer refrigerator is often defined by its door design and depth. The right fit for your home depends on the layout of your kitchen, your budget, and your personal preferences. When it comes to door design, your model can have a single door, two French doors, or multiple compartments that can be used as freezer or fridge space. When it comes to depth, you can choose from a standard-depth or counter-depth model, which will sit flush with your counters. If you want to spend less, then consider a single door model. If your kitchen is tight, consider a counter-depth model, but know it'll likely cost a bit more.</p><h3>Capacity</h3><p>The capacity of a bottom freezer refrigerator refers to the amount of space in all of the compartments combined, and is measured in cubic feet. Capacity can range from 11.9 cubic feet in narrow models, to 27 cubic feet in larger ones. You'll want to consider not only the total capacity of a fridge, but how this number breaks down between the fridge and freezer compartments. An average-sized household can typically fit a week's worth of groceries in a model with around 15 cubic feet of fresh food storage, and 6 cubic feet of frozen food storage. Also, keep in mind: the amount of space a fridge has is affected by its depth. So, a large household should consider a standard-depth model over a counter-depth one to maximize their interior.</p><h3>Ice and water dispenser</h3><p>A dispenser is not a necessity, but it is a common feature in bottom freezer fridges with a French door or multiple door design. Typically, a dispenser is located on the door of a model, and dispenses ice and water at the push of a button. Some dispense both crushed and cubed ice. High-end fridges also have dispensers with auto-filling technology, which senses the size of your cup and fills it accordingly. Your budget and the size of your household will determine whether or not your model includes a dispenser, and how advanced that dispenser is. Bottom freezer fridges with a dispenser can cost more, and that dispenser can take up interior space. If you have a large household, consider how one will impact the capacity of your model.</p><h2>Standout Features</h2><h3>Easy-open freezer handle</h3><p>It can be difficult to open the freezer portion of a bottom freezer refrigerator, due to the weight of both the materials and your frozen food. Models with an easy-open freezer handle allow you to gently lift the handle, before easily sliding out the entire compartment. This is particularly handy for larger households who may be purchasing high-capacity models, which are naturally bulkier and more filled.</p><h3>Factory-installed ice maker</h3><p>Factory-installed ice makers are already built into a bottom freezer refrigerator, so you don’t need to purchase or connect a seperate kit. This reduces the likeliness of needing repairs, or dealing with leaks in your kitchen. A household with remote workers, athletes, or avid water drinkers will find this feature most helpful, especially when paired with a water dispenser or built-in pitcher.</p><h3>Bottle and can storage</h3><p>Special storage for wine bottles and beer, seltzer, or soda cans is a convenient feature in many new refrigerators on the market. It keeps you from having to adjust door bins to fit these taller items, or designate another spot in your refrigerator for drinks. In addition, this organizational feature eliminates the need for a separate wine or beer cooler, however isn’t suitable for wine connoisseurs who should separately chill their whites and reds.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How long do bottom freezer refrigerators last?</h3><p>On average, a bottom freezer refrigerator lasts at least 10 years. Its lifespan can be lengthened if you properly maintain the appliance, avoid troublesome features like an ice maker that isn't pre-installed, and address <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/refrigerator-repair-guide-4153173" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">any needed repairs</a> right away. Every six months, change the water filter, if your unit has a dispenser. In addition, be sure to clean the condenser coils, check the temperature your fridge is at, and make sure the appliance is level. For more, see our guide on <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-maintain-your-refrigerator-1388133" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">how to maintain your refrigerator</a>.</p><h3>How do you adjust the temperature on a bottom freezer refrigerator?</h3><p>To adjust the temperature of your bottom freezer refrigerator, you'll first need to figure out if your unit has electric or manual controls. If it has electric, you can adjust the temperature using a digital pad on the exterior or within the interior of the unit. If it has manual, you can gently turn a dial to your desired temperature. (If the dial uses numbered tick marks, 1 is considered the warmest.) To safely store food, set the refrigerator temperature at 35 degrees Fahrenheit, and freezer to 0 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h3>Do bottom freezer refrigerators have more problems?</h3><p>In comparison to other styles, bottom freezer refrigerators don't have more problems or require more repairs. However, they can cost more upfront and to operate per year, in comparison to top freezer or side-by-side refrigerators. In addition, since the freezer is on the bottom of the appliance, it can be a real workout to lift the pull-out drawer or heavy items out of the compartment. Be prepared for these "flaws" when purchasing your new model.</p><h3>What is better, a side-by-side refrigerator or a bottom freezer refrigerator?</h3><p>When it comes to side-by-side and bottom freezer refrigerators, there isn't one style that's undeniably better. A side-by-side fridge is typically more narrow, so it's a better pick for small or tall kitchens, and doesn't require you to bend over to reach your frozen food. In contrast, a bottom freezer refrigerator is usually more energy efficient, and can easily accommodate bulkier items like chicken nugget boxes or a roasting chicken. To find the best one for you, figure out your priorities and see what style checks off the most boxes.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written and updated by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/marisa-casciano-5091570" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marisa Casciano</a>, who is the large appliance expert for The Spruce.

<description><![CDATA[You can now store your favorite wines in their own temperature-controlled refrigerator. We researched the best wine refrigerators for any wine lover.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wine world is fraught with pointed, opposing opinions, but one thing everyone can agree on is the fact that wine should be stored and chilled well, or the entire sipping experience is at risk. Enter the wine refrigerator, a temperature-controlled oasis for your reds, whites, and rosés. </p><p>This appliance can be your happy hour’s saving grace, but, given the sheer number of options on the market, it might be difficult to know which model is right for you and your needs. Rest assured, whether you want a home for your collection of 50-plus bottles or need to fit your beer and wine all in the same spot, there’s a cooler out there that’s perfect for you. </p><p>Here, the best wine refrigerators for your lifestyle and collection.</p><p>Your wine collection can be treated to the very best, thanks to this model by Frigidaire. It's a free-standing unit that can hold up to 24 bottles of your favorite sips, and features a see-through door that makes it easy to show off your collection when entertaining. You can divide your wine between seven shelves, and set the temperature anywhere between 41 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit. The set temperature will then display on the exterior of the appliance, so you can rest assured that your wine is in good hands.</p><p>Ultimately, this wine fridge covers all the bases, and doesn't come with a hefty price tag either. For that reason, it's our go-to pick for a wide range of households and those looking for something sleek, straightforward, and silent.</p><p>Not too big, not too small, with an LED-lit interior and sturdy free-standing design, this is the cooler that Goldilocks would undoubtedly pick—it’s just right. This cooler from NutriChef allows for both <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/storing-everything-in-the-kitchen-2648629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">wine storage</a> and display, thanks to its combination of horizontal and standing racks, so it will be right at home whether you use it in your cellar or kitchen. </p><p>This model’s adjustable temperature ranges from 41 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit and its air-tight, automatically locking door guarantees a consistent environment throughout the interior. The NutriChef’s unique blend of precision and ease of use, without any frills, makes it our pick for the wine enthusiast who wants streamlined storage.</p><p>It doesn't get more stylish and functional than this wine refrigerator by Cafe, a brand that's known for prioritizing both the former and the latter. This model not only can hold up to 46 bottles of wine, but is also outfitted with an LED light wall that gently illuminates each bottle you store. When it comes time to entertain or add new drinks to your collection, you can dim the light wall and adjust the internal temperature with an app on your smartphone.</p><p>Connoisseurs and new wine-lovers alike can also make use of dual temperature zones, which divide the interior into two, separately-controlled sections. This is ideal if you're storing reds <em>and</em> whites, since they require different environments for an optimal tasting experience. To top these features off, the fridge will notify you if the door has been left open, and you can customize the handle to match the other <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-select-cabinet-knobs-and-pulls-2109441" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">hardware in your home</a>, too.</p><p>This fridge’s storage space is divided into two separate chambers with their own temperature controls and displays, which allow you to chill your whites while keeping your reds delicately cool. The temperature settings range from 45 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit and you can fit as many as six bottles in each compartment. Despite the extent to which you can customize the cooler’s environment, its LED display makes it simple and straightforward to set up and fit to your needs.</p><p>Plus, the Koolatron’s sleek, compact design is paired with its low-vibration system. This helps it blend into whatever space or room you choose to install it in.</p><p>If the capacity of your new wine refrigerator is a top priority for you, then look no further than this GE Profile wine cooler. It can hold 57 bottles on its sliding racks, which are finished with beechwood panels. You can easily pack in your favorite wines, and pull them out for your next happy hour, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/parisian-style-progressive-meal-dinner-party-1196780" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">dinner party</a>, or holiday celebration. A reversible door, in addition to these flexible racks, makes it easy to grab your drinks, but doesn't let unwanted air slip into the interior either.</p><p>Now, this model doesn't have multiple chilling zones, but is no stranger to amenities like a stainless steel finish, and flexible design. You can install the fridge as a built-in model or a free-standing one, depending on the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-kitchen-layout-1822126" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">layout of your kitchen</a>.</p><p>A dual-zone wine fridge is perfect for the household who enjoys both reds and whites. These two types of wine should be stored at different temperatures, so that the flavors and notes aren't ruined. Of course, dual temperature zones do come with a heftier price tag, but this Samsung model makes the investment worth it. It can hold up to 51 bottles, and allows you to clearly set the internal temperature with a central control panel. The upper portion is specifically made for storing 16 bottles of white wine, while the lower portion is designed for 35 bottles of red wine.</p><p>In addition to ample storage space, this appliance has thoughtfully included sliding racks, a child lock, and a stainless steel finish. It only misses the mark when it comes to smart features, but that's easy to overlook.</p><p>With a stainless steel finish and blue internal lights, this fridge blends seamlessly and stylishly into a row of standard base cabinets. Its aesthetic form aside, its dual-temperature features allow you to store all of your wines in one place. Whites chill on the upper level while the reds sit in the separate lower level, and it’s up to you to fine-tune each compartment’s specific temperature within the respective ranges of 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 50 to 66 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>The NewAir’s <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/increase-the-efficiency-of-your-refrigerator-1388213" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">space efficiency</a> is worth noting, as well. Although it’s merely 15 inches wide, its sliding shelves can adjust to accommodate bottles of just about every shape and size, and all varieties can be stored properly, too. This cooler can also stand alone. Its locking doors have optimal insulation and UV protection, and its compressor prevents the model from shaking up the sediment in your wines. All in all, no matter where it's located, the fridge will maintain a stunningly consistent and secure environment.</p><p>From a storage space perspective, this Frigidaire Gallery model is just about the best value for your money as you’ll find on the market, holding a maximum of 52 bottles. (That number may vary depending on the size and type of bottles you opt to store.) Its six shelves are adjustable to make stocking easy, and can also fit a range of 12-ounce cans, instead of wine bottles. This allows you to make the very most of this fridge’s roominess.</p><p>Its spaciousness makes it all the more impressive that this cooler holds a steady temperature through its vast interior. Whether you want to keep your drinks at a cold 41 degrees or a cool 64 degrees Fahrenheit, it has your collection's back.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Wine Refrigerator</h2><h3>Capacity</h3><p>The capacity of wine refrigerator can be measured in cubic feet, but is often measured in the number of bottles it can hold. The most compact units on the market can hold as little as seven bottles, while the largest can hold nearly 57 bottles. For both wine connoisseurs and amateurs, a unit that can hold 24 bottles is usually enough, even when split into multiple zones. This capacity has a good balance of air flow and storage space, and doesn't give the appliance a bulky exterior which can be hard to place in your home. It leaves room for large-form bottles that aren't a standard shape and size.</p><h3>Installation type</h3><p>A wine refrigerator is either free-standing or built-in. The type of design you purchase will determine how the unit is installed in your home, and how it looks next to your other appliances and cabinets. If you want your fridge to have a streamlined look, then you'll want to opt for a built-in model that'll be snug with your cabinets and sit flush with them. If you're planning to put your wine cooler in a living room, dining room, or basement, then a free-standing model will give you the flexibility to do so, and will typically cost you less.</p><h3>Single-zone vs. dual-zone</h3><p>The interior of a wine fridge is called a "zone." The model you choose can either have one, continuous zone which is outfitted with shelves and set to a single temperature, or two zones. A dual-zone model divides the interior into two compartments, which can have unique temperature settings. This type of design is handy if you're hoping to store both reds and whites in your unit. White wine needs a chillier environment than red wine, so one compartment of a dual-zone model usually has a temperate range of 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, while the other has a range of 50 to 66 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Standout Features</h2><h3>Reversible door</h3><p>A reversible door allows you to access your wine fridge by either opening the door to the left or right. It's usually designed with recessed handles and airtight seals along both edges. Although these seals can become worn or less effective over time, this feature is handy for households with limited space, as it makes the model more flexible to install.</p><h3>Safety or child lock</h3><p>A safety lock, which is sometimes called a child lock, gives you the option to secure your wine fridge on a daily basis or while entertaining. If your household includes children or frequently has guests, it prevents unwanted entry and can ease your nerves. Typically, the lock is paired with a physical key or key fob, which should be stored in an accessible spot inside your home.</p><h3>Door alarm</h3><p>In the event that you leave your wine fridge's door open, or the door doesn't seal tight, a door alarm is very handy. It alerts you, either with a loud noise or notification to your device, that the door needs to be closed. This prevents chilled air from escaping, and the internal environment from fluctuating in a way that could ruin your wine. While this feature is typically found in high-end wine fridges, it can be worth the extra money if you have a special collection and are picky about how it's stored.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Is it worth buying a wine fridge?</h3><p>Unlike a refrigerator or washing machine, a wine fridge isn't an absolute necessity for every home. It's often considered an amenity, and addition to an in-home bar, outfitted kitchen, or finished basement. You'll want to invest in this appliance if you're a frequent wine drinker, entertainer, or host, or want to save space in your regular refrigerator. A wine fridge will add to the flavor of your wine by keeping it in the appropriate environment, and free up space in your refrigerator's door bins.</p><h3>Do wine fridges use a lot of electricity?</h3><p>Compared to a full-sized refrigerator, a wine fridge typically uses much less electricity. While you'll still run the appliance constantly, the internal environment isn't as cool. It requires less energy to maintain the temperature you set. Depending on the size of your wine fridge, it'll use between 100 and 500 kWh per year, while full-sized fridges use more than 500 kWH.</p><h3>Can you stack wine fridges?</h3><p>A majority of wine fridges on the market are not stackable, and shouldn't be stacked on top of another appliance. They should be installed according to their manual's instructions, either under a counter or in a freestanding spot in your home. If you want to maximize your storage without giving up any floor space, look for a single model that can hold up to 52 bottles or is very narrow.</p><h3>Do you put red wine in the fridge?</h3><p>Red wine can be stored in a wine fridge, but it is not recommended that you store it in a regular fridge. This is because a regular refrigerator usually has a much colder environment that can ruin a red wine's flavors after <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/store-wine-in-the-refrigerator-3511005" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow">one or two days</a>. Store red wine in a wine fridge that's set at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Store it on its side, and in a place that's still.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the times when you need to quickly clean up a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/staining-vs-soiling-whats-the-difference-2908775" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">spill</a> or get rid of a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/places-you-are-forgetting-to-clean-4140402" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">dust bunny</a>, a handheld vacuum is quite, well, handy. Instead of lugging your full-size vacuum out of the closet, a hand vac is lightweight, easily portable, and small enough to clean the crevices between furniture. They’re also ideal for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-car-interior-4775265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning your car’s interior</a>.</p><p>Of course, not all handheld vacuums are created equal. Some are better for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/inexpensive-ways-to-remove-pet-hair-2821474" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">pet hair</a>, some have a better selection of attachments, and some weigh practically nothing, making them easy for anyone to use. Below, we rounded up the best handheld vacuums on the market so you can easily find the best one for you. </p><p>What we love about this handheld vacuum is the fact that the battery can hold a charge for up to 18 months when not being used. So, even if you forget to put it on the charger, it’ll still be ready to go whenever you need it. And if you do want to store it on the charging station, it won’t hurt the battery—it automatically shuts off when it’s fully charged, which helps extend the battery life.</p><p>A translucent dust bin that makes it easier to see when it’s time to empty—plus, you can tell just how much dirt and debris the vacuum is sucking up. The slim nozzle which extends and rotates to get to hard-to-reach places, and the general power of the little machine are a few other points in this model’s favor. The bright charging light and the machine's operating volume might be a little disruptive, but if you can look past those factors, it’s solid choice for most households. </p><p>A number one bestseller in its category, this handheld vacuum is a solid choice, and won't cost much. Whether you don’t want to spend a ton on an additional appliance, or you’re looking for one to the dorms with your first-year college student, look no further. This little red machine gets the job done with a surprising amount of power.</p><p>It has an easy-to-empty cup and smart crevice tool. The only drawback with this model is that it is tethered to a cord, which limits its mobility. You won’t be able to vacuum out your car with it, unless you have a serious extension cord. But for most uses, the 16-foot, built-in cord should work just fine. We also like that it weighs less than four pounds (not having a battery cuts down on overall weight) making it light enough for anyone to use.</p><p>This model from Bissell is a high-quality cordless, handheld vacuum that only weighs 3 pounds! But it’s not a lightweight in terms of cleaning power. It’s strong enough to pick up pet hair and other messes around the house (it’s even great for cleaning out other devices—like the filter on your upright vacuum).</p><p>This is also a great option for cleaning carpets and stairs, thanks to the accompanying motorized brush tool. Meanwhile, the upholstery tool helps clean softer surfaces that might attract and hold on to more hair and dust. While it’s not as powerful as its corded counterparts, if you’re looking for a light cordless device that will get the job done, this is your machine.</p><p>If you share your home with a furry friend, you’ll definitely want a handheld vacuum. It’s the easiest way to make sure you don’t have a layer of pet hair all over your furniture. This model from Bissell (which is similar to our best lightweight recommendation) has a couple of key features that make it the best at tackling all the fur your pets leave behind.</p><p>First, it the specialized rubber nozzle brushes upholstery to attract pet hair and help remove it from the furniture. The nozzle is flexible to conform to the contours of your sofa and stairs so no hair gets left behind. The other nozzle is best for harder surfaces and sucking up crumbs or debris. Second, the filtration system makes sure that any allergens from your pet’s hair are trapped in the vacuum.</p><p>The corded model is relatively light at only five pounds and has a 16-foot cord to reach most spaces in your home. This model really is best on furniture, but it can handle most messes on hard wood floors as well.</p><p>If you’re as concerned with wet spills as you are with dry messes, you may want to consider one that can clean up both —and this Meiyou vacuum is a great option. Weighing less than two pounds and featuring a 23-minute battery life, it’s easy to handle and maneuver around entire rooms without having to recharge. The attachable crevice tool comes in handy when cleaning nooks and crannies around the house. </p><p>Also included is the brush attachment, which works best on carpets and upholstery. Paired with this model’s impressive suction, this feature makes one of the hardest vacuuming tasks (read: dredging up embedded hair, dirt, and dander) a snap.</p><p>For such a powerful little vacuum, the Meiyou is surprisingly easy to clean: The reusable stainless filter can be washed by hand and the dust cap releases with the push of a button, so you can get back to cleaning your home faster.</p><p>Bagless options offer convenience and ease of use, since they’re easier to empty and cheaper to maintain, but bagged alternatives offer certain advantages, too, especially to those who deal with allergies and want a vacuum that efficiently traps and seals in dust and dander.</p><p>This MetroVac is one such alternative, featuring powerful suction, solid steel construction, and two attachments that tackle messes in hard-to-reach places and on upholstery (a crevice tool and a dust brush, respectively). Its weight (2.7 pounds) and the fact that it works just as well on carpet as it does on hard wood make it a surprisingly versatile and compact option, as well.</p><p>The Shark WANDVAC is a worthy investment not only for its sleek, lightweight design but also for its powerful, high-efficiency suction (which comes as a result of its high-speed, brushless motor). </p><p>Although the WANDVAC weighs less than one and a half pounds, it can capture small and large debris equally well (and its one-touch release design means you won’t get that dust all over your hands when you clean it out). Since it can run for about 10 minutes at a time on a full charge, the WANDVAC is best suited for quick jobs around the house or cleaning out the car. It comes with a crevice-cleaning tool that’s ideal for sucking dirt and grime from tough spots, a multi-surface pet tool, and charging dock.</p><p>Looking for a simple hand vacuum that can be transformed into something more? The secret lies within the attachments, and this BLACK+DECKER machine has some of the best around. The compact, cordless unit has a flexible plastic hose built in that extends its reach up to four feet. It also comes with a rubberized brush for picking up pet hair, a flip-up dusting brush, a crevice tool, and even a stick attachment to clean the floor. With all those add-ons, you might just be able to replace your upright vacuum with this model.</p><p>When not in use all those attachments have a home in the charging station, making it easy to keep things organized. While the suction isn’t the most powerful compared to other handhelds, it’s a great device if you’re looking for one that can convert into a stick vac.</p><p>Cleaning up excess sand is a uniquely annoying chore, but the Shark UltraCyclone is a great hand vacuum to make the task go by quickly. In addition to sand, it handily sucks up pet hair, dirt, and dust, using a self-cleaning brushroll. Even stuck-on, ingrained sand and dirt will lift away, thanks to the attachable scrubbing brush.</p><p>At less than three pounds, the UltraCyclone handles easily and can be maneuvered all around the house and throughout your car, as well. </p><h2>What to Look for in a Handheld Vacuum</h2><h3>Weight</h3><p>Because you have to carry handheld vacuums around to use them, it’s important to check how much they weigh. Some lighter options clock in at just a few pounds, making them easy for anyone to handle, but some larger units with hoses and attachments can be bulkier and heavier — not great for kids or those with physical limitations.</p><h3>Runtime</h3><p>A lot of handheld vacuums are cordless, so they run on battery power. Of course, these products don’t have infinite runtime — on average, one charge will provide around 20 minutes of suction. If you plan to use your handheld vacuum for longer than this, you may want to look for a corded model, which isn’t as portable but doesn’t have the same time limitations.</p><h3>Hose and attachments</h3><p>If you have a particular use in mind for your handheld vacuum—like cleaning your car or removing pet hair from furniture—you may want to consider a model that comes with a hose, special attachments, or both. A hose will help you get into more cracks and crevices, and pet hair/upholstery attachments will help you get the job done in less time. However, keep in mind that these features often make the vacuum heavier.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I clean a handheld vacuum?</h3><p>You'll first need to empty your handheld vacuum, which will entail either removing and throwing away its dust bag or releasing its dust cup into the trash. From there, you can wipe out remaining dust from the vacuum's interior with a microfiber cloth. Refer to your model's manual to see whether you can disassemble it further and use soap and water to clean it. Some handheld vacuum manufacturers advise against washing their units and, instead, sticking with wiping them down or rinsing them. If you can get your handheld vacuum's parts wet, allow time for them to dry before reassembling.</p><h3>How often should I clean a handheld vacuum?</h3><p>It's important to empty your handheld vacuum before it reaches or exceed maximum capacity (allowing it to run with a full bag or cup will inhibit its performance), so keep an eye on its dust levels after big cleanups. You can perform a light maintenance check on your model as frequently as once a month, while you should deeply clean it every six to 12 months, depending on how heavily you use it.</p><h3>How long do handheld vacuums work?</h3><p>Generally speaking, your handheld vacuum should last for several years. How much you use it and the scale of the messes you use it on will determine its exact lifespan. When you notice a decline in performance, check to make sure your handheld vacuum's bag or dust cup is empty, its filter is cleaned, and its battery doesn't need replacing. Emptying, cleaning, and maintaining your unit will extend its life.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

<title>The 8 Best Water Softeners of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/NAG3nUtrRooY25-p-96mSFom-oA=/3865x2576/shower-head-98157818-5a985ba40e23d900370b4d2f.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[A good water softener removes harmful minerals and is simple to maintain. We researched the best water softeners so you can select the right one for your home.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many households have a hard water supply, but a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-water-softener-systems-2718697" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">water softener</a> can take care of this common household problem. Hard water causes scale inside your pipes and can damage the heating element of appliances like dishwashers and washing machines. Using a water softener can avoid these problems, while also giving you softer skin and hair, fluffier laundry, and fewer spots on your glassware. You’ll also be able to use less soap to enjoy more suds when bathing, doing dishes, or cleaning clothes. </p><p>Conventional water softeners are salt-based systems that require you to refill a salt storage tank regularly. However, some people choose to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/installing-a-water-softener-2718669" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">install</a> a salt-free water conditioner, which doesn’t remove hard minerals from the water but instead treats them to prevent scale. When choosing a water softener system, factor in how hard your water is and how many gallons you use each day on average to find the set-up that is right for your home.</p><p>Smart and efficient are two ways to describe the functionality of this popular whole house water softener. The GE GXSH40V has a 40,200 grain capacity—sufficient for typical 4 person households. It features GE’s SmartSoft technology, which allows the system to detect water usage patterns and optimize regeneration schedules so that softened water is available during peak periods of usage. Regeneration takes about 2 hours and uses 37 gallons of water. </p><p>One of the most unique features of the GE GXSH40V is its blending valve, which allows you to adjust the hardness of your water to match your needs. Using the digital controller, you can adjust water hardness levels, conserving salt usage or increasing water softness to suit your preference. The controller will also provide you with a ‘Days to Empty’ indicator, giving you an at-a-glance indicator of when it’s time to add more to the 230-pound capacity salt bin. </p><p>While water softener systems can frequently creep past $500 or $1,000 depending on filtration abilities and features, the Waterboss 900 is an economical choice. This budget water softener system is compact and cost-effective yet still equipped to handle the water needs of an average 3-4 person household. </p><p>This water softener has a 36,400-grain capacity and filters water with a hardness up to 90 GPG. Impressively, the regeneration cycle takes just 24 minutes and uses only 17.2 gallons of water. A user-friendly digital controller controls the softener’s settings and regeneration. As with many other water softeners, this compact unit includes a bypass valve to preserve media life. </p><p>When paired with water filtration components, a water softener system can reduce the mineral content of your water while also improving the smell and taste of your drinking water. The GE GXMH31H Water Softener and Filter in One accomplishes both purposes with one compact set-up. </p><p>This water softener system is capable of reducing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-water-softener-systems-2718697" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">hard water</a> up to 120 grains per gallon and can filter 31,100 grains before regeneration. Regeneration is fairly speedy, at just 105 minutes but it does use a hefty amount of water (54.7 gallons) when compared to similar softeners. </p><p>In addition to softening water to your preferred hardness using a custom blending valve, the GE Water Softener and Filter in One filters chlorine, which improves the taste and odor of water. You might notice that your hair is smoother and your skin is softer after showering with water that has been filtered to remove chlorine. </p><p>A water softener for well water is typically equipped with an iron filter. This additional filter helps to address the specific needs of homes supplied by well water and reduces the presence of iron and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/remove-rust-stains-from-toilets-tubs-4109490" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">rust stains</a> on sinks, tubs, and toilets.</p><p>Aquasure’s Harmony series is outfitted with fine mesh resin that captures minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron. It has the ability to filter water with a hardness up to 110 GPG. Choose between water softeners with the capacity to filter 32,000, 48,000, or 64,000 GPG before regeneration is needed. The regeneration cycle uses 40 gallons of water and lasts 98 minutes. Regardless of the size tank you choose, the Aquasure has a digital control console that monitors water consumption and regulates the frequency of regeneration. </p><p>Salt-based water softeners are a familiar sight in homes supplied by hard water. Besides reducing scale, softened water can preserve the life of your appliances, eliminate spots on your dishes, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/solving-hard-water-laundry-problems-2146651" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">soften your laundry</a>, hair, and skin. A popular and affordable salt-based softener for average-sized households is the Rheem Preferred 32,000 Grain Water Softener. </p><p>This model from Rheem uses a treated resin bed to capture calcium and magnesium particles from hard water. After processing 32,000 grains, the system will regenerate—which takes 2 hours and uses 24 gallons of water. The salt storage tank holds 175 pounds and needs periodic refilling, but the system has a low salt monitor that will provide a visual alert when the salt supply is running low. Rheem also equipped this model with technology to detect water usage patterns and optimize regeneration cycles to conserve salt, water, and energy. </p><p>The NaturSoft Water Softener Alternative System from Pelican Water provides an option for homeowners looking for a salt-free water softener. Instead of relying on sodium or potassium chloride to attract and capture minerals and soften water, the NaturSoft system neutralizes hard minerals like calcium and magnesium. The minerals remain in the water supply but won’t adhere to plumbing fixtures. It’s the only water softener alternative to be certified by the DVGW as an anti-scale device, making it an effective choice for water treatment. </p><p>The benefit of a water conditioner like the NaturSoft from Pelican is its maintenance-free design. There’s no need to buy salt and refill it on a weekly basis. In fact, the NaturSoft granules inside the tank never need to be recharged or replaced. Other reasons to consider a water softener alternative include concerns over increased sodium levels in your water supply or to avoid the "slippery" feel of water softened by salt. </p><p>Harness the power of an electrical current to reduce scale and condition your home’s water supply. The ScaleBlaster SB-75 is compact—measuring just 4.75 x 7.5 inches. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/installing-a-water-softener-2718669" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Installation</a> is simple in comparison with larger conventional salt-based water softeners; it requires a coil to be wrapped around the incoming main water line and plugs into a nearby electrical outlet. Some electric water softeners are only compatible with specific types of water pipes, but the SB-75 can be used with copper, PVC, CPVC, and PEX pipes. </p><p>Keep in mind that the ScaleBlaster SB-75 is limited in treating water with a hardness up to 19 GPG. It works by sending out an electrical current that alters calcium molecules, preventing them from adhering to pipes and fixtures. At the same time, the conditioned water helps to reduce the existing scale from your pipes. </p><p>Very hard water can tax standard duty water softeners, leading to frequent regeneration cycles, increased salt consumption, and shorter media life. Households that have very hard water may benefit from a heavy-duty water softener, which has a higher maximum grain capacity than typical water softeners.  </p><p>This heavy-duty water softener from Pelican Water is rated to capture 80,000 grains and process 4,000 gallons of water before regeneration is necessary. Maximum hardness removal is 75 grains per gallon, which is not as high as some other water softeners but is much higher than average water hardness levels in most areas. Regeneration cycles take 105 minutes and use 100 gallons of water, but the system includes a controller for a metered backwash function to reduce the use of unnecessary water. </p><p>Keep in mind that more is not always better when it comes to water softeners. You should test your water hardness, estimate your gallons of usage per day, and choose a system that is sized right for your home rather than just buying the most robust water softener on the market. However, a heavy-duty water softener like this model is a good choice if you have a large household and more than three bathrooms that demand a regular supply of soft water. </p><h2>What to Look for in a Water Softener</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>There are three types of water softeners: salt-based softeners, salt-free water conditioners, and electromagnetic conditioners. </p><p>Salt-based softeners are the most popular systems for residential use. However, they do require ongoing attention and maintenance. Homeowners will need to purchase a supply of sodium chloride or potassium chloride regularly and keep the salt holding tank full for regeneration. Resin media generally has about a 10-year lifespan, but it depends on water quality and usage.</p><p>Salt-free and electromagnetic water conditioners don’t remove calcium and magnesium particles from the water. Instead, these systems neutralize the particles to eliminate their ability to stick to plumbing fixtures and appliances. The benefit of conditioned water is that it prevents scale build-up without the need to regularly buy salt and add it to the system. </p><h3>Capacity</h3><p>Water softener capacity is usually indicated in how many particles the system can filter before needing a regeneration cycle. Capacity generally ranges from about 28,000 grains for small water softeners to 80,000 grains for heavy-duty softener systems. An average-sized water softener for three to four-person households is usually in the range of 32,000 to 40,000 grains. </p><h3>Bypass Valve</h3><p>A bypass valve enables you to divert water from the softener system, which can be useful in a number of situations. When turned on, the valve will direct the flow from your water pipe past the softener system—enabling you to work on the softener without shutting off water to the whole house. A bypass valve is also sometimes useful when using a volume of water where water hardness is not an issue. For example, if you’re doing yardwork it might make sense to divert water from the softener. Doing so saves the resin media from filtering water unnecessarily and shortening the time until the system’s next regeneration cycle. </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do water softeners work? </h3><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/water-softeners-how-they-work-1824916" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Water softeners</a> work by using coated resin beads (which have a negative ion charge) to attract and capture particles responsible for water hardness—specifically calcium and magnesium (which have a positive charge). These particles bind to the resin while the treated water flows through the resin bed and through your home’s plumbing system. </p><h3>How do you clean a water softener? </h3><p>To maintain peak performance, water softeners require regular regeneration. Essentially, this is the process that ‘cleans’ the resin bed. Over time, the resin bed becomes coated with grains of calcium and magnesium and will be unable to bind more particles. The system will typically monitor how much water has been processed and regenerate as needed. </p><p>Regeneration involves a brine rinse and backwash. An attached salt tank supplies the sodium necessary for the brine bath that washes the resin bed. The ions in the sodium of the brine will bind the calcium and magnesium particles and carry them away with a single or double backwash. </p><p>If your system is failing to perform and you notice hard water flowing from your pipes, you will want to check and see if a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/repair-a-water-softener-salt-bridge-4125777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">salt bridge</a> has formed. This is essentially a layer of crusted salt that prevents the salt from reaching the brine tank and removing hard minerals from the water. Turn off your water supply or engage the bypass valve to divert water from your softener system. Break up the solidified salt using a broom handle or other tool, scoop out the salt that is now floating in the tank, and then vacuum the water in the tank using a wet vac.</p><h3>How long do water softeners last?</h3><p>The lifespan of a water softener is dependent on the longevity of the resin bed. In a conventional salt-based water softener, the resin bed usually lasts for 10 to 20 years. How long your water softener lasts will largely depend on water hardness and usage. Very hard water and frequent regeneration may shorten the lifespan of the treated resin inside your water softener.  </p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/erica-puisis-4174129" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Erica Puisis</a>, a professional writer that specializes in large and small appliances for the home.

This cordless stick vacuum comes with a variety of useful attachments, and it delivers up to 40 minutes of run time when using a non-motorized tool and 8 minutes on its max-power setting.</p><p>The Dyson V8 delivers 150 percent more brush bar power than other Dyson stick vacuums, and it has whole-machine <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/do-i-need-a-hepa-filter-1901189" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEPA filtration</a> to help capture allergens and other small particles (for more vacuums that boast a HEPA bag or filter, take a look at the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-vacuums-for-allergies-4685937" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">best vacuums for allergies</a>). It comes with a direct-drive motorhead, soft roller cleaner head, a mini-motorized tool, soft dusting brush, and more which allow you to use it for a wide variety of applications. Plus, you can take the stick portion off to convert it into a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-handheld-vacuums-to-buy-4066047" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer">handheld vacuum</a>.</p><p>The vacuum comes with a wall-mounted charging port, and it’s surprisingly powerful for a battery-powered machine. Plus, the hygienic dirt ejector allows you to empty the bin by simply pulling a lever—no need to get your hands dirty!</p><p>Another top-performing cordless stick <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-vacuum-cleaners-4062974" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">vacuum</a> is the Hoover Linx. While this lightweight model resembles a small upright vacuum, it manages to deliver the same power you’d expect from a regular Hoover vacuum. Why? It's powered by a fade-free lithium-ion battery system, and unlike other cordless vacuums, it has a removable battery that you charge in a port, as opposed to plugging in the whole tool. The controls for this vacuum are right on the handle, and the battery fuel gauge lets you know how much battery life is left.</p><p>Most vacuums struggle to reach underneath furniture for a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/intensely-clean-a-living-room-1900918" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">deep clean</a>, but the low-profile base and extreme-recline handle allow the Hoover Linx to thoroughly clean hard to reach areas. This machine also has edge-cleaning bristles that let you clean closer to walls, and the wide brush head will shave minutes off your cleaning time.</p><p>While it may not have the longevity of other stick vacuums, and it doesn’t include any attachments, the Hoover Linx is a great option for those who want a compact, lightweight vacuum at a reasonable price.</p><p>You can get both a stick vacuum and handheld vacuum with the versatile BLACK+DECKER Cordless 2-N-1 Stick Vacuum. This handy two-in-one model is easy to push thanks to the swivel steering, and it has several <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-cleaner-features-1901184" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful features</a> that make it a valuable tool to have around the house.</p><p>This stick vacuum has automatic suction adjustment as you move from hard floors to carpets, and its powered beater bar agitates dust and dirt that might be trapped in your rugs. It can vacuum up to 2,500 square feet per charge, and the Smart Tech sensing technology lets you know how much battery power is remaining. The vacuum comes with an extendable crevice tool and brush attachment, as well as a washable filter.</p><p>This vacuum stands up on its own and includes a handheld vacuum. Plus, many say the suction is impressive for such a small machine, and you can’t beat the reasonable price.</p><p>If you are looking for the ultimate cordless dirt buster for your home this new LG buy does it all. It has 200 watts of suction and when you use the backup battery, you get 120 minutes of run time. The HEPA-filter reduces 99.9-percent of dust so you can breathe easy.</p><p>Our tester remarked that after she vacuumed with a regular vacuum she used this model and so much more dirt came up in the vacuum. Her small children were also a big fan of it and it was easy to maneuver for the whole family. One con she experienced was that this wasn't that great at picking up Cheerios!</p><p>High-end cordless stick vacuums can cost $500 or more, but if your purse strings are a little tight, you may want to consider a more affordable option like the Dirt Devil Versa. This 3-in-1 vacuum can be used on rugs, hard floors, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/carpeting-on-stairs-2908873" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">carpeted stairs,</a> and more, and it even converts into a handheld vacuum to clean up smaller messes.</p><p>This budget-friendly cordless stick vacuum is the perfect combination of lightweight and powerful, thanks to its lithium battery that delivers fade-free suction and faster charging. The Spin3Pro Brushroll works on a variety of surfaces, and the vacuum is light enough that you can easily use it overhead to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vacuum-dust-from-walls-and-ceilings-1901138" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean the walls</a>, windows, or molding. Plus, you won’t have to worry about losing the charger, as there’s a spot to store it right on the vacuum. The Dirt Devil Versa has a rinsable filter and easy-empty dirt bin, and it's the perfect tool for touch-ups throughout the week.</p><p>Some vacuums don’t do a good job <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/simple-steps-to-beautiful-hardwood-floors-1976382" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning hard floors</a>, so if your home has a lot of hardwood or tile, you’ll want a powerful cordless stick vacuum like the Dyson Cyclone V10 Absolute. With more power and a bigger dust bin, this vacuum will be your new favorite tool when it comes to cleaning hard floors.</p><p>The Dyson V10 Absolute can run for up to 60 minutes per charge, depending on what setting you’re using. It comes with a special soft roller cleaning head that won't scratch the finish on hard floors, and it's engineered to pick up both large debris and fine dust particles. Choose from three power modes, depending on what type of mess you’re tackling and how big it is. Plus, it boasts whole-machine filtration system that traps small debris to keep your air cleaner.</p><p>This vacuum can transform into a handheld for smaller jobs, and it includes the standard drop-in, wall-mounted dock that comes with most Dyson stick vacuums. Thanks to its ability to pick up dirt, dust, and hair off hardwood, tile, and laminate floors, this stick vacuum is comparable to a full-size corded model.</p><p>You can clean both carpets <em>and</em> hard floors with the Shark Navigator Freestyle Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner. This highly rated model has an extra-large dust cup, is easy to move around, and works especially well for pet hair!</p><p>This vacuum's biggest advantage is that it can be used on different types of flooring. It has a two-speed brush roll that you can adjust, and the bristles on the brush roll are soft so they won't scratch <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-make-hardwood-floors-shine-1901094" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">shiny hardwood floors</a>. The powerful suction system will capture dirt, dust, hair, and more. When you're done cleaning, it charges in roughly four hours.</p><p>If you’re looking for an incredibly light stick vacuum that won’t strain your hands or arms, one of the best choices is the MOOSOO Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, which weighs less than 3 pounds. This handy, bagless vacuum has a high-powered motor that runs quietly and can last up to 30 minutes per charge depending on the power mode.</p><p>The MOOSOO vacuum comes with a motorized brush roll, as well as a soft brush roller, dusting brush, and crevice nozzle. There are two power modes (standard or max) to choose from, and the vacuum has a HEPA filter that will capture 99.99 percent of little dust particles and other allergens, keeping your air clean. The large dust canister empties with a push of a button, and the MOOSOO Vacuum delivers impressive suction on a variety of surfaces.</p><p>Fight back against pet hair with the super-powerful Dyson V11 Animal Cord-Free Vacuum, which has several features specially designed for those with pets. It delivers twice as much suction as other cordless vacuums, and it can run for up to an hour per charge.</p><p>The Dyson V11 comes with three settings—eco, auto, and boost mode—and it automatically changes the motor speed as you move between carpets and hard floors. This stick vacuum is unbeatable when it comes to removing pet hair from carpets and upholstery, and the whole-machine filtration system removes microscopic particles from the air (hint: you can also keep your air clean by using an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-air-purifiers-4062977" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">air purifier</a>). The Dyson V11 comes with a wall-mounted charging dock, and it's a must-have tool for anyone who has multiple pets, as it will help you <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/remove-pet-hair-from-clothes-2146741" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">get the hair off your belongings</a> more quickly.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Cordless Stick Vacuum</h2><h3>Battery</h3><p>Most cordless stick vacuums have run times between 15 and 40 minutes. Look for lithium or lithium-ion batteries, which charge faster and last longer. A vacuum that runs for 20 minutes or more will sufficiently clean a small apartment or roughly 1,000 square feet.</p><h3>Power</h3><p>Voltage indicates power, which affects the machine’s ability to suck up dust, dirt, and other debris. A vacuum with 18 volts will suffice, but you’ll notice the difference in a 20-volt vacuum.</p><h3>Noise level</h3><p>Vacuum noise is rated by decibels. A typical conversation has a decibel rating of about 60, while the standard vacuum clocks in between 70 to 80 decibels. Some premium models have decibel ratings as low as 65.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Are there bagged cordless stick vacuums?</h3><p>Cordless stick vacuums tend to be bagless, due to their slim, minimal design. Instead, they rely on built-in dust cups and filters to contain the dust, dirt, and debris they suck up. It's important to empty your stick vacuum regularly to ensure optimal performance.</p><h3>Do all cordless stick vacuums have docking stations?</h3><p>Docking stations are a common two-in-one charging and storage solution for cordless stick vacuums, but there is a chance that your model of choice won't come with one. Instead, it will either have a simple charging cord or use replaceable batteries. Models that don't come with docking stations may fold up or break down for easier storage.</p><h3>What can I expect from a cordless stick vacuum in terms of suction?</h3><p>While advanced cordless stick models offer plenty of suction in a relatively compact package, you shouldn't expect the average stick vacuum to match the kind of suction you'd expect from an upright vacuum. In general, cordless stick vacuums work best on lower-pile rugs and hard floors (high-pile carpets demand stronger suction than they can provide). This makes cordless stick vacuums the better choice for small homes or quick, supplemental cleaning, as opposed to whole home deep-cleaning.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was edited and updated by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

Stackable washers and dryers have plenty of room inside to tackle a full-size load of laundry, but take up a minimal amount of space. The dryers in these sets are typically front-loading, while the matching washer may load from the front or top depending on the kit's design. A laundry center, which might be particularly convenient in a tiny apartment where your appliances must fit into a closet, is essentially a tower of laundry power. It has a compact washer topped with an efficient dryer, which you can easily shop for in gas or electric to fit your exact laundry needs.</p><p>Whether you’re short on space, or simply want more room for folding clothes and storing supplies, take a look at these top stackable washer and dryer sets.</p><p>The Samsung WF45R6100AP is a powerful, front-loading washer with 4.5 cubic of space, that stacks well with its matching DVE45R6100P dryer. Together, they make reliability and accessibility a priority, which is why they're both jam-packed with additional features. For instance, the washer has 10 different wash cycles to choose from, as well as a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/washer-steam-feature-1908409" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">steam function</a> and sanitize setting. The dryer features a reversible door so you can tailor your laundry set-up to what's most convenient for you. You likely won't need to designate time in your day for touch-up cycles or ironing, since the dryer also has a steam function and is proven to perform well.</p><p>In addition, this duo looks sleek, thanks to its platinum finish. Install them side by side, on top of each other, or under a counter, and you'll actually look forward to tossing in a load. Each can be put on a matching pedestal, so you don't have to reach down to switch clothes, sheets, or heavier items like a bulky comforter.</p><p>If quiet operation is important to you and your household, this set is also a quality pick as it doesn't produce much noise. All in all, this stackable washer and dryer has everything and then some, making it our best pick overall.</p><p>You might think buying a stackable washer and dryer will cost a small fortune, but the Amana NFW5800HW is an affordable option with a few less special features. Amana has a reputation for offering value-driven appliances, that might not have all the bells and whistles, but are easy to use with relatively few problems. </p><p>This stackable front load washer and its matching dryer are no exception. These machines provide a thorough clean, and are a great introduction to front-loading washers and dryers. Neither unit has steam or WiFi capabilities, but most homes don’t miss those amenities at this amazingly low price point. On the contrary, you will likely rave about the automatic dispenser for <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/remove-softener-and-dryer-sheet-stains-2146656" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">fabric softener</a> in the washer. It ensures you don’t have to wait around to pause the load at just the right time, to add the liquid in.</p><p>In addition, the dryer is equipped with an automatic drying sensor, so you won’t toast your clothes with a too-long cycle. On both machines, the large door gives you plenty of access to the drum inside, making it easy to load and unload your laundry.</p><p>If you want to take advantage of a space-saving laundry center, and are looking for a gas-powered dryer, look no further than the this model from GE. Despite the unit’s stacked design, it gives you a generous 3.9 cubic feet of washer space and 5.9 cubic feet of space in the matching dryer. Now, the washer has a newer style of agitation thanks to an impeller plate. However, you'll enjoy how this element of design leaves more room for large loads or thick blankets.</p><p>While laundry centers are usually relatively simple in design, there are some very desirable features in this stackable, gas-powered washer and dryer. The washer features a stainless steel tub that won’t chip or snag clothes, in addition to plenty of cycles that allow you to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-select-the-correct-cycle-2145866" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">select the correct setting</a> for loads like delicates, vivid colors, or bulky blankets. The control panel is positioned on the upper portion of the unit, but is still easy to reach.</p><p>For an electric laundry center, the LG WKEX200HBA is a spacious and highly functional pick. It features a front-loading washer with 4.5 cubic feet of space, and a front-loading dryer with 7.4 cubic feet. Typically, it's not common to find a laundry center where both sections are front-loading. This element of design alone is eye-catching and useful for any household.</p><p>Thoughtful and unique design continues with a central control panel that houses touch controls for both of the units. Instead of pulling out a stool or asking the tallest member of your family to start the top unit, you can easily select one of 10 wash cycles and nine drying cycles on your own. Once the cycle has begun, it can be monitored from the LG ThinQ app on your smartphone, which also remembers your favorite cycles for future use. Now, this particular model doesn't come with special settings for activewear or allergens. It does, however, have vibration reduction technology to ensure the unit operates quietly, and dispensers for detergent, fabric softener, bleach, and pre-wash detergent. It's also outfitted with a steam function that can gently eliminate dust, dander, and pollen from your clothes.</p><p>A stackable washer and dryer doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice capacity. The LG WM3600HWA, and its matching dryer, are very spacious so you can work through plenty of laundry with one cycle. The washer of this dynamic duo has a 4.5-cubic-foot drum and 10 cycle settings, while the dryer features 7.4 cubic feet of space and an additional 10 cycle settings. In order to turn them into one, tall unit, you have to purchase the separate stacking kit. But, will then be treated to more space in your laundry room, and an efficient laundry routine.</p><p>The washing machine is a high-efficiency model that works to conserve water and energy with every load. It has a cold wash setting, and an automatic sensor that recognizes size and fabric type. The drum is made of stainless steel, ensuring that it'll last a long time and won't get chipped, like porcelain enamel tubs often do. In addition, a speed wash setting completely cleans your clothes in just 15 minutes, while dryer syncing can select the appropriate dryer settings for you and get things drying in no time. Essentially, this feature allows your washer to send your wash selections over to the dryer unit, which then decides what drying cycle and temperature is most suitable.</p><p>The best smart stackable washer and dryer is, hands down, this innovative piece from GE. The front-loading washer and its matching dryer offer the convenience of a stackable set, along with plenty of other perks that make this pair worth the splurge. </p><p>As you’d probably expect for a smart set, both machines are equipped with built-in WiFi. This feature lets you receive notifications on your phone, check a cycle's status, and even start or stop a load remotely. In addition, you can use this model with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, to seamlessly integrate them into your smart home and streamline your laundry routine. This line by GE also includes a feature called "washer link" to sync the washer's settings with the dryer, and save you the hassle of selecting options for each load when you transfer clothes to the dryer. </p><p>Plus, the washer is equipped with an in-door vent system that helps <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-disinfect-a-washer-2147320" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">prevent the growth of mold and mildew</a>—a common cause of odors in front-loading washers. The gasket, drain, and dispenser system are made with Microban technology to deter the growth of bacteria in parts that are frequently exposed to moisture, too.</p><p>While many stackable washers and dryers promise quiet operation, this model by Maytag actually delivers on this promise. This front load washer, and its matching stackable dryer, are built with the brand's commercial technology. Together, they are a heavy-duty set that's designed to last. Now, despite the commercial design, the controls are anything but clunky. Both units have a central dial where you can select one of 10 different wash cycles and 10 different dry cycles. Plus, a modern, digital keypad lets you make further selections for each cycle setting. </p><p>Once in operation, you'll find the washer a has smooth, efficient performance. It's also fairly quiet, making it a good pick for first floor laundry rooms or closets next to a bedroom. You may even forget that its running, since it's so quiet, and if you do, you’ll be happy that the Fresh Spin option keeps your clothes tumbling for 12 hours to guard against wrinkles.</p><p>For a real space-saver, check out the Whirlpool WET4024HW stacked washer and dryer. This unit is compact but offers efficiency and capacity, if you need to do more with less, or are shopping for an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/options-for-apartment-washers-and-dryers-4153000" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment washer and dryer</a>. It can fit into small spaces like a linen or hallway closet, and includes rare features, such as a see-through lid to check the status of the load, as well as automatic bleach and fabric softener dispensers. </p><p>The wash tub is only 1.6 cubic feet, but features an impeller plate for agitation—which means there is more room in the basket for laundry. The impeller plate can really add functionality to this piece, and allow it to handle a full load of clothes. If you don't mind the machine being a bit noisy, it'll certainly do a thorough job. Put your load in the dryer, which has a drum size of 3.4 cubic feet, and make use of an auto-dry sensor next, that'll stop the cycle once the load is dry.</p><h2>What to Look for in Stackable Washers and Dryers</h2><h3>Laundry center vs. standalone models</h3><p>You can buy a washer and dryer set as standalone models, or as an integrated laundry center or tower. Standalone models offer more spacious drums, so you can tackle more laundry at once, as well as the flexibility to separate the two units at any time. However, their control panels can be difficult to reach, if they're not located in a central location. In contrast, a laundry center or tower doesn't usually have a large capacity, but can offer a central control panel. A laundry center features a top-load washer and a front-load dryer, most commonly. If you prefer to have two, front-loading models, there are options on the market, though.</p><h3>Power source</h3><p>A dryer, whether it's a part of a laundry center or a standalone model, can be powered by electricity or gas. When shopping, you'll need to pick which power source suits your home and budget best. Usually, a gas-powered model is a bit more expensive upfront, as it requires professional installation. However, once it's installed, a gas model will be cheaper to operate, and will be more gentle on your clothes. Any home with a 240-volt outlet can opt for an electric model, but should be prepared for a slight increase in their electric bill.</p><h3>Steam function</h3><p>A steam function, which can be found in both a washer and dryer, helps to reduce wrinkles in clothes, tackle odors and stains, and quickly freshen items that you don't want to put through an entire cycle. This feature is fairly common in washers and dryers, but may not be found in laundry centers or more budget-friendly picks. Although it's not an absolute necessity, it definitely makes your routine easier and more thorough, which is why it's worth considering when shopping.</p><h2>Standout Features</h2><h3>Impeller plate</h3><p>Top-loading washer units, which can be found in laundry centers, can have a central agitator or an impeller plate. An impeller plate is a newer and more gentle option that's built into the bottom of the washer's drum. It moves so your clothes are thoroughly spun, soaked, and mixed with soap, but does not have attached fans, which helps it be more gentle on a variety of fabrics. It's a great feature for households that run delicate cycles or wash activewear often.</p><h3>Dryer syncing</h3><p>Dryer syncing allows a washer to "speak" to its matching dryer, and automatically choose settings for your loads. The two models connect, and then the washer sends over the details of your wash cycles so the dryer can match them. This feature is ideal if you wash activewear, wool, baby wear, or clothes that need special treatment often. It's also most suitable for households who trust their appliances to do the work for them, and don't mind a hands-free experience.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How big is a stackable washer and dryer?</h3><p>A standalone, stackable washer or dryer is typically about 40 inches tall and 28 inches wide. When it's stacked with its counterpart, the set is then 80 inches tall, but remains 28 inches wide. Most units will require you to purchase a separate stacking kit, which helps to stabilize the two appliances and might add an inch or so to the overall height of your laundry machines. You can make up for this by adjusting the legs of your machine, so it sits lower. In contrast, a laundry center measures a bit smaller at just 75 inches tall and 25 inches wide, and will save you the most space.</p><h3>How do you install a stackable washer and dryer?</h3><p>To install a stackable set that's made of two standalone units, you'll first need to buy the compatible stacking kit. This kit will contain screws, spacers, and brackets for stabilizing the dryer on top of the washer. From there, remove the dryer's legs if it has them and attach the spacers very securely. You will want to have the dryer carefully leaned on its side for this step. Next, add the correct brackets to the washer, and prepare to lift the dryer on top of the washer and secure these brackets. You'll want to ask someone to help you, as large appliances can be very heavy and bulky.</p><p>Once the two models are stacked, you can set up the necessary ducts, lines, and power cords. Now, each stackable set is a little different, so be sure to follow your user manual for proper installation.</p><h3>Are all front-loading washers and dryers stackable?</h3><p>Most standalone, front-loading washers and dryers are stackable, but not all. For that reason, it's key to read over the specifications for an appliance before purchasing it, if you'd like to have the flexibility of stacking your models. In addition, plan to purchase a washer and dryer at the same time, as certain standalone models are made to be a stackable set. Certain retailers may bundle them, so you can save money. Plus, this will make installing and using the features much easier.</p><h3>Do stackable washers and dryers have to be stacked?</h3><p>If you purchase a standalone washer and dryer that's stackable, you have the option to stack the two models or install them separately. This is convenient if you're hoping to renovate your laundry room or see yourself taking the machines to another space. Laundry centers don't have this flexibility and will have to remain stacked, since the washer and dryer are completely attached.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was edited and updated by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/marisa-casciano-5091570" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marisa Casciano</a>, who is the large appliance expert for The Spruce.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/I1OjXhDvd4U_R7B9rFgL3Y-Lm20=/1280x854/Diatomaceous_Earth-56a6d35f5f9b58b7d0e4ffa5.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="A sample of food-grade diatomaceous Earth" width="1280" height="854" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">SprocketRocket/Wikimedia Commons/CC0 1.0</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've heard the term diatomaceous, you may want to learn its actual definition. Also known as DE, diatomite or kieselgur/kieselguhr, diatomaceous earth occurs naturally and is similar to pumice. It is typically ground down so it is not too abrasive to the touch. It can be used in toothpaste and metal polishes, and is also found as a plastic filler, cat litter, thermal insulator, liquid absorbent, blood-clotting activator, and yes, insecticide. It is great at killing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-get-rid-of-aphids-2539837" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">aphids</a>, beetle grubs, ants, and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/controlling-ugly-home-and-garden-pests-2656427" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">squash bugs</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿</p><h2>How Diatomaceous Earth Works</h2><p>Diatomaceous earth works by cutting the pest, causing it to dry up and die. It absorbs lipids from their waxy outer layers and causes them to dehydrate. In the case of slugs and snails, DE can be sprinkled on the ground and on plants they eat, and the sharp edges will cut them as they slide across the diatomaceous earth. It can be tough to kill <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/outdoor-pest-control-4127877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">slugs</a> using it since the areas they occupy are often very moist. DE will abrade pests internally, though, so eventually, they will die. </p><h2>How to Use Diatomaceous Earth</h2><p>Safety matters when handling DE. A mask should be worn at all times when working with DE, because it is very irritating if inhaled.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ It should be used sparingly, since it can be equally damaging to beneficial insects. You don't want to add too much, so be sure to read the direction on the package very carefully. </p><p>To keep slugs from devouring young carrot foliage, sprinkle that area of the garden with diatomaceous earth. Use food-grade diatomaceous earth; filter-grade DE may contain harmful silica. Otherwise, it's not harmful to humans. </p><h2>DE Application Methods</h2><p>For the dry method, fill a shaker container with diatomaceous earth, using a spoon to transfer the powder into the container as to avoid dust. Just because it's non-toxic to humans doesn't mean you want to breathe it in, especially if you have any respiratory issues.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿</p><p>During early mornings or late evenings, shake the powder onto plants. You want to do it then to take advantage of natural moisture, which helps it stay on the plants. Put it on veggies and leaves. </p><p>Shake the powder onto the vegetable plants. The best time to do this is in the early morning or late evening when the plants are wet with dew. The moisture helps the dust to adhere to the plant. Diatomaceous earth won’t harm insects when it is wet, but it will be effective once it dries. Shake the powder on the vegetables as well as the leaves; the powder can be easily washed off the vegetables prior to consumption. In addition to the garden, spread it around the area surrounding the garden. You can pour a thick ring around plants to deter slugs, squash bugs, and snails.​</p><p>If it's another time of day, use the wet application method. Pour four tablespoons of diatomaceous earth into a one-gallon jug filled with water. Put the top on and shake the container until the mixture is dissolved. Pour the liquid into a spray bottle and spray the plants. You want them to be wet but not dripping. Pay attention to getting the undersides of leaves, too. Once they dry, the DE water will glue to the plants and display a thin powder coating. This is a good way to apply DE on a windy day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Learn How to Grow and Care for a Dwarf Alberta Spruce</title>

<description><![CDATA[Learn to grow and care for a Dwarf Alberta spruce (Picea glauca &#39;Conica&#39;) with these helpful tips on growing conditions, maintenance, and more.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/AluKmCdbn6DXIPfx9R9J4JT_MMM=/4000x2642/dwarf-alberta-spruce-trees-2132080-hero-dde7e7657d79487e8647c7412a62b306.JPG" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Dwarf Alberta trees shaped as cones in middle of garden " width="4000" height="2642" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><p>The dwarf Alberta spruce is diminutive evergreen with a classic pyramidal Christmas tree shape. This <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/twelve-spruce-trees-and-shrubs-3269669" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">spruce variety</a> is related to some giant varieties that can grow 100 feet or taller but because dwarf Alberta spruce rarely exceeds about 13 feet, it is a popular choice for foundation plantings and as a specimen plant all over America. This dwarf version of the white spruce grows very slowly—growing just 2 to 4 inches per year, and it is generally grown as a large shrub or small specimen tree. The aromatic green needles are about 3/4 inch long, and the tree has a tight, densely-packed growth habit that gives dwarf Alberta spruce trees a "fuzzy" look. Unlike its larger cousins, the white spruces, dwarf Alberta spruce rarely produces pine cones.</p><h2>How to Grow Dwarf Alberta Spruce</h2><p>The dwarf Alberta spruce tree can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 8, but it is temperamental further south than zone 6. This specimen is best suited for a climate with cold winters and cool summers. A Dwarf Alberta spruce tree grows best in full sun and well-drained <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-acidic-soil-p2-2130997" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">acidic soil</a>. It will tolerate some light shade but performs best in a spot with good air circulation, since its dense foliage can trap moisture.</p><p>If the soil is less than ideal, amend it by working compost or another organic material into the top 15 inches of soil before planting. The planting hole should be twice as wide as the tree's container, and about 2 inches deeper. Water thoroughly after planting, and cover the ground around the tree with a thick layer of shredded bark mulch; keep the mulch a full 3 inches away from the trunk.</p><p>For the first year, water the tree weekly, saturating the soil to a depth of at least 3 inches.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/Iqm4nLQvDYGa02K1aar5Y8FBzRo=/4000x2636/dwarf-alberta-spruce-trees-2132080-01-b70405ab78d747ff80d3e46358967555.JPG" alt="Dwarf Alberta tree on gravel ground in front of other evergreen trees" width="4000" height="2636" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/_CB28gLIsZ27ggml8d0I5eJp5G4=/3856x2619/dwarf-alberta-spruce-trees-2132080-04-651a114539f9433db1052cc488067582.JPG" alt="Dwarf Alberta tree top covered in snow in front of yellow-branched tree" width="3856" height="2619" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/koG7YSrzE_alwqTCzfQVvQQXFxM=/4000x2670/dwarf-alberta-spruce-trees-2132080-05-4f68f42e35ce4e909ed807ae15559586.JPG" alt="Dwarf Alberta trees with fluffy branches standing in front of each other" width="4000" height="2670" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/ii_Mn-DFfvWU6qZAYNBvTjXHQXI=/4200x2845/dwarf-alberta-spruce-trees-2132080-06-17ddb8ed552d4950bc1977173c413563.JPG" alt="Dwarf Alberta tree branches with spiky-leafed branches" width="4200" height="2845" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Evgeniya Vlasova</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Growing in Containers</h2><p>This tree is often grown in a container to use as a living Christmas tree. It can be moved outdoors in the early spring but needs to be hardened off by gradually exposing it to cooler conditions.</p><h2>Light</h2><p>This tree performs best in full sun but will tolerate some shade.</p><h2>Soil</h2><p>Grow dwarf Alberta spruce in moist, well-drained soil. It does best in soil that is slightly acid to neutral in pH.</p><h2>Water</h2><p>Provide these trees with water when the top 3 inches of soil becomes dry. Container specimens will need more water than those planted in the landscape.</p><h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2><p>This tree requires <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/air-circulation-for-plants-1402549" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">good air circulation</a> and does best in low-humidity environments. It performs best in areas with cold winters and cool summers.</p><h2>Fertilizer</h2><p>Young plants respond well to mixing in a granular fertilizer around the base of the tree once a year. Mature trees require no feeding.</p><h2>Pruning</h2><p>Pruning is not necessary with dwarf Alberta spruce since it grows so slowly. Damaged branches should be removed whenever you find them. Pruning to shape them can be done in late winter or early spring when new growth starts to appear. Cut no more than 2 to 3 inches off the tips of the branches.</p><h2>Propagating Dwarf Alberta Spruce</h2><p>This tree can be propagated by 6-inch-long branch cuttings taken in late summer or early fall. Strip the needles from the lower two-thirds of the shoot, then plant them deep into sandy loam soil. Keep the soil moist until roots form, then transplant into a pots or a landscape location.</p><h2>Landscape Uses</h2><p>Dwarf Alberta spruce trees are used as specimens in landscape design. As one of the most recognizable shrub/tree types in North American landscaping, you'll often see them used in pairs to flank the entryway to a house for a formal look that strives for balance. Because dwarf Alberta spruce trees will remain relatively small for a number of years, people sometimes treat them (at least initially) as container plants. They are sometimes <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-topiary-plants-4175802" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">trimmed into topiary forms</a> when grown in containers. </p><p>However, be aware that these specimens will eventually outgrow a small space. It is best to avoid planting this tree in a spot that cannot comfortably accommodate what may eventually become a 10- to 13-foot tree.</p><h2>Common Pests/ Diseases</h2><p>Dwarf Alberta spruce trees are not very tolerant of air pollution and salt spray, and they struggle in areas with high heat and humidity. They require very little care but are often the victims of <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/controlling-spider-mites-3269371" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">spider mite</a> attacks that can kill the tree. A yearly preventative treatment with a pesticide may prevent this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Learn How To Decorate Bohemian Style</title>

<description><![CDATA[Bohemian or Boho style is rule-breaking, personal, and exotic. Learn how to bring the allure of Boho into every part of your decorating.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/S3TwlMIbbDGjEnTSgq2G9GUa73A=/1500x1000/decorators-guide-to-bohemian-style-1977570_hero3265-d12ad5e481774445b581803ff78bb15a.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="a bohemian decor moodboard" width="1500" height="1000" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Margot Cavin</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bohemian or Boho decorating is for those who want their homes full of life, culture, and interesting items for all the world to see. This aesthetic flies in the face of modern sensibilities and embraces the carefree, relaxed, and the unusual. Boho rooms tend to have certain similarities in that they are always eclectic and share similar features though no two rooms are ever completely alike.</p><p>Boho is inspired by people who choose to lead an unconventional life such as constant travelers, actors, and writers. The Bohemian style mirrors that life by combining objects, colors, and patterns from many areas of the world. If you are looking for a style that you can truly make your own, Boho might be for you.</p><h2>Bohemian Colors</h2><p>While there are no rules when it comes to Bohemian decorating, warm earthy colors are common, as are metallics and jewel tones. Think deep browns, greens, and grays for base colors, and then accessorize with saturated purple, fiery orange, and electric blue. Combining and layering colors is what makes this style unique.</p><p>Feel free to mix patterns and textures, and don't be afraid to use styles that would not necessarily go together in a conventional way. Use dyed textiles and patterns from around the world—like Ikat from Cambodia or Suzani from Central Asia—to give the space a sense of fun and exoticism. Layer throws on top of furniture and try hanging tapestries and area rugs on the walls alongside your photos and art. If this all seems a bit much, keep in mind that while saturated color is key to the Bohemian style, white ​<em>can</em> have a place as a backdrop for richer tones. Use white to strategically bring a little visual space into the equation.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/r4ghUa3zS2YdgopQjdirrzfTgfI=/3735x2668/decorators-guide-to-bohemian-style-1977570-bohemian-colors-678c5a2a60994dc7a74cc2fb2705c45e.jpg" alt="bookcase and global decor elements" width="3735" height="2668" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Ali Elshabrawi</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Decorative Materials</h2><p>As the opposite of minimal, modern, and sleek, Boho embraces a "more is more" philosophy. The key to using decorative materials in a Boho room is to mix and match. Natural, basic materials like burlap and sisal can be combined with silk and chenille. The materials should have a slightly worn look—not damaged, but not shiny and new either. Fringe, crochet, and macramé abound—pillows, curtains, and throw-rugs combine to make a cozy, globally-inspired hangout. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/beautiful-boho-bedroom-decorating-ideas-4119470" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canopies over beds</a> and living areas are signature Boho embellishments.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/PzndoN8YLeAY74oWIi40BBGCjyc=/5315x3544/decorators-guide-to-bohemian-style-1977570-pillows-40d1ac9f2d0a48d195501ee65bf71f77.jpg" alt="bohemian decor elements" width="5315" height="3544" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce / Candace Madonna</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Bohemian Furniture</h2><p>Bohemian furniture usually is not found in a store. These rooms tend to be filled with furniture collected over time, so second-hand and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vintage-furniture-1391684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage</a> items are right at home here. Each piece of furniture should be special and tell a story. Have fun exploring your local vintage shops and choose each piece individually. If you love it, it will fit right in.</p><p>Both you and your guests will feel the Boho vibe with plush chairs and couches in saturated colors. Throw rugs or overstuffed floor pillows will create a welcoming floor-seating atmosphere. And since a Boho room should have a “sit and stay awhile” feel, streamlined or straight-backed furniture will not fit in here. Choose comfortable, relaxed pieces like chaises longues, daybeds, or butterfly chairs.</p><h2>Lighting and Accessories</h2><p>Ambient, understated <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/master-bedroom-lighting-ideas-4145021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> will unify your Boho room and complete the calm and welcoming feel. Rather than overhead fixtures, decorate with multiple lanterns, candles, and floor and table lamps. Today’s global design markets make it easy to find a variety of shapes and styles—perfect for the mix-and-match look.</p><p>Embracing the natural world is central to this style, so bring your room to life with ferns and hanging plants. Not only do they lend vibrancy to a room, but plants also improve air quality, so the more the merrier. Philodendron and peace lilies are very forgiving and withstand a variety of light and temperature levels. Or consider succulents—widely available in a range of colors and textures—which are great for people with a less-than-green thumb. These eye-catching plants need little more than a sunny spot and occasional watering.</p><p>Finally, pull together your <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/beautiful-boho-bedroom-decorating-ideas-4119470" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boho room</a> with family <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/collecting-antiques-4162954" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">heirlooms</a>, handmade items, and objects from your travels. Accessories should be personal, so feature what you love: tapestries, vintage bottles, maps, or mismatched china—you name it. And keep in mind that while Bohemian style tends to be eclectic, it can still be chic and glamorous, so do not be afraid to try out an ornate chandelier or a chunky gold-framed mirror. The only rule is that every item in the room should share something about you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>The 6 Best Dyson Vacuums of 2021</title>
<enclosure url="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/lPeh6aaG2k6AHzgn2NRGWAQpzMA=/2099x1429/GettyImages-667652097-5c2122d5c9e77c0001a46191.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg" />
<description><![CDATA[A top vacuum has great suction, easy maneuverability, and helpful features. We researched and tested the top Dyson models so you can pick the right one for your home.]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aesthetically, Dyson vacuum cleaners are sleek, distinctive and stylish, as pleasant to look at as they are to use. And, speaking of their performance, few brands are as consistently satisfying as Dyson. It's no surprise, then, that some of The Spruce's best-reviewed vacuums, ranging from stick models to canister varieties, happen to be Dysons.</p><p>Here, the best Dyson vacuums available now.</p><p>For a powerful Dyson vacuum cleaner that does it all , your best bet is the Dyson Small Ball Multi Floor Upright Vacuum Cleaner. This upright model is easy to use and impressively powerful.</p><p>Weighing just over 12 lbs, the Dyson Small Ball upright vacuum is easy to carry, yet still delivers powerful suction. It has an advanced, self-adjusting cleaner head that seals in suction whether you're on hard floors or carpet, and the cleaner head features carbon fiber filaments to catch fine dust particles. The vacuum's ball technology lets you easily steer it into tight corners, and the retractable handle makes it more compact for storage.</p><p>Users love how lightweight this vacuum is, writing that it's easy to move around multi-level homes. Many note that easy to maneuver and empty, and it picks up dirt and debris that other vacuum cleaners would likely leave behind.</p><p>If you're looking for an incredibly lightweight, portable vacuum cleaner with impressive suction power, you can’t go wrong with the Dyson V8 Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner.</p><p>This vacuum’s cordless design provides up to 40 minutes of powerful suction per charge, and it boasts a HEPA filtration system to remove allergens from your home. Its cleaner head drives bristles deeper into carpet to remove as much dirt as possible, yet the stick vacuum is still safe for hard floors, thanks to its soft roller cleaner head.</p><p>The main downside of this model is the canister only holds around 2 cups of debris, so you may have to empty it frequently if you're vacuuming a large area. Despite this, this stick vacuum is incredibly convenient, lightweight, easy to maneuver, and performs wonderfully.</p><p>It can be tough work to keep your home clean if you have one or more pets, which is why Dyson has a special line of vacuums just for animal owners. One of the best options available today is the Dyson Ball Animal 2 Upright Vacuum.</p><p>Weighing in at just 15 pounds, the Dyson Ball Animal 2 is an upright vacuum cleaner that delivers both in terms of power and efficiency. It features a self-adjusting cleaner head that switches between carpets and hard floors with ease, and it has the strongest suction of any vacuum, so it can easily pull dirt and hair from carpets. Plus, it also features an instant-release wand and long-reach hose to clean under furniture and even up walls.</p><p>This Dyson vacuum comes with a tangle-free turbine tool to help you remove pet hair from carpets and furniture, and pet owners say it's absolutely worth the price. The suction is unparalleled and the machine is incredibly durable, even if you clean your home multiples times per week.</p><p>Cordless vacuums provide unparalleled portability, as you don't need to search around for a nearby outlet to clean up messes. If you're looking for an affordable cordless vacuum, consider the Dyson V7 Motorhead Cordless Stick Vacuum. While it doesn't boast as long a runtime as the newer V8 model, it still performs incredibly well in a variety of situations.</p><p>This cordless stick vacuum weighs just a few pounds and provides up to 30 minutes of suction per charge. The cleaner head features stiff nylon bristles to remove dirt from both carpets and hard floors, and the high-speed motor is designed for powerful suction.</p><p>This particular Dyson is lightweight, easy to maneuver, relatively quiet, and picks up an impressive amount of dirt.</p><p>If you live in a home without much carpet, you may be worried about scratching up your hard floors with an unwieldy vacuum. Luckily, there’s the Dyson Cyclone V10 Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner, which will help you keep the hardwood, tile, and other hard floors in your home sparkling clean without scratching them in the process.</p><p>This exceedingly lightweight vacuum cleaner features a soft roller cleaning head that's designed to capture both large debris and fine dust in one pass. It provides around 40 minutes of run-time when using the soft roller head, but it can run for as long as an hour when using a non-motorized tool. Thanks to its impressive performance, this vacuum all you need to get your home clean if you mostly have hardwood or laminate floors in your home as the suction is powerful and it's easy to operate.</p><p>One of Dyson's latest models is a souped up stick vacuum with a fitting name. This version of the V11 gets its "outsize" label for its cleaner head, which covers 25 percent more floor than Dyson's regular V11. This additional coverage works in tandem with the brush bar's stiff bristles and Dyson's signature suction technology to ensure faster cleanups overall, even on carpeting. Tracked-in dirt and debris that isn't removed by the regular cleaner head is dredged up by the attachable stubborn dirt brush and mini motorized tool. Other attachments include a soft dusting brush, crevice tool, and combination tool.</p><p>This machine weighs less than eight pounds, features a half-gallon dust bin, and can run for up to 120 minutes. A unique combination of agility and power, the V11 Outsize allows you to clean entire rooms with wall-to-wall carpet without breaking a sweat.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Dyson Vacuum</h2><h3>Type</h3><p>Dyson's product line is relatively wide ranging, offering upright, canister, handheld, and cordless stick options. Each type is naturally well-suited to a particular cleaning job. For example, handheld and stick vacuums are great for quick messes, while upright vacuums are powerful enough to clean carpets. Depending on the kind of cleaning you hope to accomplish with your new Dyson, one type might be a better pick for you.</p><h3>Intended use</h3><p>Some Dysons are designed to clean specific areas around the house, like hardwood floors, tight spaces, or carpets. Others are equipped with features made to handle specific messes, like pet hair or smaller dry spills. You can expect powerful suction and reliable performance from Dysons across the board, but paying attention to these specialized capabilities and intended uses will help you determine which model is best for your cleaning needs.</p><h3>Feel</h3><p>In the same way that different varieties of Dysons have different cleaning strengths, they also have different user experiences. A powerhouse upright vacuum might not be as nimble or maneuverable as a cordless stick vacuum, which, in turn, might not be as lightweight as a handheld model. If you plan on using your vacuum for extended periods at a time or across multiple floors of your home, you might be better off with one that's easy to lift and move from room to room. If you vacuum is likely to stay on the same floor, you probably don't have to look as closely at its weight while shopping.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do I empty a Dyson vacuum?</h3><p>As soon as your model's dust cup reaches its maximum capacity, usually denoted by a line on the cup, it's time to empty it. Waiting and operating your vacuum with a full dust cup will diminish its overall efficiency and cleaning power. If you have an upright or canister model, lift the cup away from the body of the vacuum by its handle. Hold it over the trash and press the catch or button on top of the cup to empty it. If your model is a stick vacuum, hold it over the trash by the handle and pull the release lever to empty the built-in cup.</p><h3>How do I clean a Dyson vacuum?</h3><p>After emptying your Dyson's dust cup, rinse it out with water. Dyson's reusable <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/troubleshooting/Cleaning-Filters" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">filters</a> should be cleaned the same way, with nothing more than cold water. The rest of the interior can be cleaned with a dry dust rag and can of compressed air, and don't forget to remove any hair from the brush bar (manually or with a pair of scissors). Make sure all parts are dry before reassembling your Dyson.</p><h3>How long do Dyson vacuums last?</h3><p>All Dyson machines come with a <a href="https://www.dyson.com/inside-dyson/terms/the-dyson-warranty" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">warranty</a>, but its length will depend on which machine you choose. Cordless Dysons are covered for two years, while corded models are covered for five. Under this warranty, Dyson will repair your vacuum and replace parts for it as needed, which will help ensure its continued performance for years after you purchase it. Warranty aside, your Dyson's lifespan will depend on how much you use it and what you do to maintain it.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce’s small appliances expert.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/8VUn7DqqBARYvu6fj_cpGAUqGAw=/2001x1334/SPR-Home-v1-The-7-Best-Above-Ground-Pools-of-2021-4163972-primary-6de2c881dfd3445aa6e514c056bd7326.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Best Above-Ground Pools" width="2001" height="1334" /><figcaption><span class="copyright">The Spruce</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you live in a warm climate or anywhere that gets remotely hot during the summer, having somewhere to swim can make the weather more bearable—and enjoyable. As you're probably aware, in-ground swimming pools are expensive to install and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pool-maintenance-tips-2682532" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintain</a>. Above-ground pools, however, are an <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/above-ground-pool-cost-4847129" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable alternative</a>. They're also much easier to set up and can be just as fun as their in-ground counterparts.</p><p>Whether you're looking for a budget-friendly cool-down solution or want to try out a pool before committing to digging a permanent <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-to-know-before-building-a-swimming-pool-2736836" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">hole in your yard</a>, we've got you covered. We rounded up the best above-ground pools currently on the market, including saltwater-ready, rectangular, round, oval, steel-supported, and inflatable picks. Let's dive in.</p><p>Here, the best above ground pools on the market.</p><p>For an above-ground option that shines above the rest, we recommend the Intex Ultra XTR Pool Set. Aside from the actual pool, it comes with a sand filter pump, a ladder with slip-resistant steps, a ground cloth, and a cover with a convenient rope tie. The efficient filter pump has a flow rate of 2,100 gallons per hour, plus a built-in timer with preset cycles.</p><p>The reliable frame is made of galvanized steel and connects with a precision-engineered locking system, adding to the overall stability and durability of the product. Thanks to a protective powder coating on the interior and exterior walls, this pool also resists rust. The round Intex Ultra XTR is 52 inches tall and 18 feet in diameter. It holds over 6,900 gallons of water and is ready to fill within 45 minutes.</p><p>The Intex Ultra Frame Rectangular Pool is 52 inches deep and comes in various sizes. You can get 216 x 108 inches (18 x 9 feet), 288 x 144 inches (24 x 12 feet), or 384 x 192 inches (32 x 16 feet). The set includes a filter pump, a slip-resistant ladder, a ground cloth, and a debris cover.</p><p>Like all Intex above-ground pools, you can count on high-quality engineering, durability, and weather resistance. A puncture-resistant, triple-ply liner ensures water stays in, and powder-coated steel frames reinforce the walls. Thanks to dual-suction outlets, this pool efficiently circulates water while <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/tips-buying-owning-above-ground-pool-2736832" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">keeping it clean</a> and clear for as long as possible.</p><p>If you're interested in a blow-up option that's a bit larger and more sturdy than your typical kiddie pool, we recommend the Summer Waves Quick Set. This circular pool measures 96 inches (8 feet) in diameter. It's 30 inches deep and can hold over 600 gallons of water. Designed specifically for super-fast installation, you can set it up in minutes. And unlike most inflatable pools, it comes with a filter pump.</p><p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/saltwater-pool-and-how-it-works-2736556" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saltwater pools</a> are having a moment, and they aren't reserved only for in-ground models. The best above-ground option is this Intex Ultra XTR Rectangular Set with Saltwater System. You'll need to buy your own salt, which you'll add to the saltwater system to achieve an ideal level of salinity.</p><p>This sizable pool is 52 inches deep and measures 384 inches (32 feet) x 192 inches (16 feet). It's perfect for swimming laps, splashing, floating, or playing games. Aside from the saltwater system, you'll get a sand filter pump, ladder, ground cloth, and a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/smart-reasons-to-cover-a-pool-2736581" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">pool cover</a>. Intex also backs this pool with a two-year warranty.</p><p>The best above-ground pool with a steel frame is the Coleman Power Steel Vista Series II. It's 216 inches (18 feet) in diameter and 48 inches deep with an impressive 6,100-gallon capacity. This pool is very <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/building-above-ground-swimming-pool-4847278" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy to set up</a> and take down—no tools are needed. The exterior has a rattan print, and the interior walls have a tile design, making it an attractive addition to your yard.</p><p>As for the frame, reinforced portholes are built into the walls, and corrosion-resistant steel secures the whole thing together. Made of puncture-resistant Tritech, the outer liner is notably tough too.</p><p>If you're looking for a safe, affordable solution for entertaining kids outside in warm weather, the H2OGO! Underwater Oasis Spray Pool. They'll love the included inflatable dolphins, which can be connected to your garden hose to spray water (or used for other games, like a ring toss). The pool as a whole can hold up to 555 gallons of water—and at more than 8 feet wide, there's plenty of room for multiple kiddos to splash around.</p><p>Parents will also be happy to know that this pool is super easy to set up: it takes just under 10 minutes to inflate, deflate, and store, so you can easily schedule playtime, anytime. What's more, the 3-ply Tritech liner is puncture-resistant (and it also comes with a repair patch, just in case), making this a pool that will last you for seasons to come.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Above-Ground Pool</h2><h3>Size</h3><p>When buying an above-ground pool, one of the most important considerations is size. While this should go without saying, you'll need to make sure it not only fits in your yard but that you'll have at least a few feet of space on all sides. We recommend measuring your outdoor area a couple of times before buying an above-ground pool. Though it depends on the model, rectangular and oval pools tend to be the largest, with water capacities of up to 20,000. If you're short on square footage, a smaller round pool might be your best bet.</p><h3>Type</h3><p>There are also a few different <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/swimming-pool-types-designs-and-styles-2737104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">types of above-ground pools</a>. You've got standard pools, which typically have either steel walls or tear-resistant PVC walls supported by steel frames. There are also inflatable options, which are usually made of the same PVC material but without a steel frame. Inflatable pools tend to be the most portable and affordable. You can also get a saltwater-ready pool. This type of above-ground pool comes with a saltwater system (also known as a salt chlorinator) for achieving the right salinity, though you'll need to <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/helpful-pool-saltwater-apps-online-calculators-2736293" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">add your own salt</a>.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>A lot of above-ground pools come in sets, meaning they have all the necessary components for setting up, using and maintaining your pool. This often includes a filter pump, a pool liner, a ground cloth, and a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/smart-reasons-to-cover-a-pool-2736581" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">debris cover</a>. Some larger pools also come with slip-resistant ladders. Additionally, you can find above-ground pools with dual-suction outlets for easier cleaning. Others have built-in chemical dispensers, eliminating the need for free-floating cleaners.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How do you install an above-ground pool?</h3><p>The proper way to install an above-ground pool depends on the type. However, there's a general process to follow when <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/building-above-ground-swimming-pool-4847278" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">setting up standard pools</a> with PVC walls and steel frames. After clearing an area and making sure the ground is level, start by laying down the ground cloth and placing the bottom plate on top.</p><p>Next, connect the metal rails to the bottom plate and around the perimeter. Then connect the vertical side rails to the bottom portion of the frame. Be sure to read the directions carefully, as the different metal rods can look similar but won't line up or connect properly if you use the wrong ones.</p><p>After that, install the lining onto the bottom plate and up the walls. When finished, your pool should have a balanced shape, and the walls should all be the same height.</p><h3>How do you clean an above-ground pool?</h3><p>Generally speaking, above-ground pools can be cleaned using the same <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pool-cleaners-you-should-buy-2736546" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools and methods</a> as in-ground pools. You can use a pool skimmer, which draws water from the pool's surface and sucks it through the filter. Another option is a pool hose, which attaches to your filter or pool vacuum and sucks out debris. You can also use a pool net to manually fish out leaves, bugs, dirt, and other debris.</p><h3>How do you drain an above-ground pool?</h3><p>Start by unrolling the pump's intake hose, reaching it as close as possible to the center of your above-ground pool. Then point the hose outlet toward an area that will drain the water away from the pool without flooding your property. Next, plug the pump into a nearby outlet and turn it on. Allow the pump to run until your pool is completely empty. This might take several hours or more, depending on the size of your pool. Turn off the pump, and you should be all set.</p><h2>Why Trust The Spruce?</h2><p>This roundup was researched and written by <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/theresa-holland-5095480" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Theresa Holland</a>, a professional writer, and a homeowner who is always on the lookout for products that enhance the at-home experience.
