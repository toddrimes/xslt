In northern states, the Red Maple usually grows in wet bottomland, river flood plains, and wet woods. In the midwest, it tends to grow in drier, rocky upland areas. It is very cold hardy in USDA Zones 3 through 9. Spreading 30 to 50 feet wide, it grows 40 to 70 feet tall with a rounded to oval crown. Red maples grow faster than Norway or sugar maples, but slower than silver maples. All emerging new growth in the form of leaves, leafstalks, twigs, flowers, fruit, and fall foliage are red or tinged with red. Flowers are typically red, sometimes yellow, in large clusters, blooming from March to April. After the flowers, come the leaves. The leaves start dark green above and gray green below. They are 2 to 5 inches long with 3 or 5 primary triangular-shaped, toothed, pointed lobes. Samara fruit is also initially reddish producing a two-winged samara.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Winged Elm (<em><a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/ten-species-of-elm-trees-3269656\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">Ulmus</a> alata</em>) is another deciduous tree that gives way to samaras. This elm is native to southern Virginia west to Kentucky, southern Indiana and Illinois, and central Missouri; south to central Oklahoma and southeastern Texas; and east to central Florida. It also grows in Maryland. When placed in an open area, branches arch upward to create a rounded crown. In a forested site, the tree grows taller and straighter. Naturally, Winged Elm can be seen growing freely in rock outcrops, dry wooded areas, and fields. Bark is red-brown to ash gray. Leaves have doubly toothed margins. In fall, they turn yellow and in late winter, small red flowers mature in clusters. The tree produces 1/4- to 1/2-inch flattened samara with hairy margins. Other common names for the Winged Elm are Cork Elm, Small Leaf Elm, Wahoo Winged Elm, and Witch Elm. Prune this tree regularly to prevent it from growing multiple trunks.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Common hoptree (<em>Ptelea trifoliata</em>) is native to Eastern and central United States, hardy in Zones 4 through 9. This native, deciduous tree is sometimes considered a shrub because it grows a modest 15 to 20 feet tall and wide. The hoptree is dense and rounded, making it an ideal specimen for a flowering hedge. Naturally, it grows in open woods, glades, ravines, thickets, and prairies. Leaves are shiny, dark green, each two to five inches long, turning greenish yellow in autumn. Fragrant, tiny clusters of tiny greenish white flowers bloom in late spring. These clusters of flowers produce clusters of seeds, each seed encased in a thin, winged one-inch samara. Seeds mature in late summer and last through most of winter. The common name of hoptree refers to the prior use of seeds as a substitute for hops. Other common names include wafer ash and stinking ash.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Light","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Grow Red Maple and Winged Elm in full sun to part shade.

Remove the outer covering before eating the seeds from maple trees. When seeds are young and green in spring, they are known to be the most pleasant tasting. Sprinkle them into a salad or stir-fry or mix them into mashed potatoes. Since different varieties of maples produce samaras at different times of the year in certain areas, seeds might be available for harvest and consumption for an extended period. Store the seeds to continue eating them through summer, fall, and perhaps winter if you have enough to last a full year. Roast or boil them if mature seeds taste bitter.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading2","text":"Common Pests and Diseases","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Aphids, borers, scale, and caterpillars are common pests to the Red Maple.
