A high-capacity tank means you\u2019ll spend less time emptying out its contents\u2014and since the filter can be washed, you won\u2019t have to replace it often. At a little over 13 pounds, it\u2019s lightweight enough to clean all around your home\u200b and includes a brush, extender and crevice tool to clean in those hard-to-reach corners.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"The BISSELL PowerForce Helix vacuum has surprisingly powerful suction for being on the smaller side. Plus, the canister is well-designed, making it easy to empty out dirt into the trash without accidental spills (a common issue with some bagless vacuums).","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Canister vacuums are designed differently than their upright cousins, with a cleaning nozzle linked to the vacuum by a hose. Eureka\u2019s Mighty Mite canister vacuum is compact and lightweight at 8.5 pounds but includes a powerful motor that effectively cleans any surface. The benefit of the canister design is that it\u2019s highly versatile, making it easier to clean above the floor than it would be using an upright vacuum. Eureka includes two extension wands, a crevice tool and an upholstery brush with the main vacuum, so it\u2019s a breeze to take its cleaning power wherever you need it.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"You can\u2019t beat this vacuum for the value, and it can clean everything from the furniture to the walls. It\u2019s particularly good on staircases\u200b since you can carry it from step to step with little effort.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"For lighter, hands-free cleaning, the Eufy RoboVac 15T is a solid pick. Like other robotic vacuums, this model roams around your home cleaning up hair, dirt, and dust without your help. At less than 3 inches tall, it can get dust bunnies under dressers and couches, and can run for up to 100 minutes at a time before it needs to dock and recharge.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"While this option doesn't have some of the newer features of other vacuums, like floor mapping or smart home compatibility, it's a good choice to keep your floors tidy in between deeper cleans.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"If you suffer from allergies, pet hair is basically your kryptonite. And as hard is it can be to stay on top of the buildup, a vacuum designed with your needs in mind is a great way to fight back against fur. Hoover\u2019s Total Home Pet vacuum includes numerous features that help sweep away pet hair, like a brush roll that you can activate for carpets and turn off for hardwoods. It also comes with various multipurpose pet hair tools to help lift even the most stubborn fur, as well as an odor-absorbing filter to keep pet-related smells to a minimum.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"Who says you need a huge, closet-filling vacuum to take care of the toughest dirt? Black & Decker\u2019s Dustbuster packs a ton of high-powered suction into a tiny package just over 2.5 pounds. It\u2019s great for cleaning high-up shelves, inside cabinets, in your car\u2014and, well, pretty much anywhere else. The bowl and filter are fully washable and easy to empty, while a simple brush attachment makes it easy to transition to cleaning upholstery.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"The Dustbuster holds its charge for a long time (it takes about four hours to reach full power), and handles easily thanks to its light weight. The flip-up brush is also surprisingly multifaceted\u2014it should come in handy for cleaning baseboards.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"A cordless stick vacuum like Dyson\u2019s V8 saves on space but doesn't skim on power. For as long as 40 minutes at a time, this model removes dirt from hard floors and rugs alike. The mini motorized tool is particularly useful when it comes to dredging up tracked-in debris and pet hair.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"The V8 is a breeze to use, saving you time on quick messes while providing an intensive clean, thanks in no small part to its whole-machine HEPA filtration system, which efficiently traps allergens and expels fresh air. Then, when the time comes to empty the dust cup, you can do so with the push of a single, hassle-free button.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"When cleaning an area rug or carpeted room, you don't just want your vacuum to remove surface-level dirt but embedded debris, as well. You can trust the Hoover Elite Rewind vacuum to tackle both tasks, thanks to its powerful, adjustable suction technology that's designed to lift away messes, even from high pile carpets. In its wake, this model leaves carpets and floors deeply clean: Its HEPA media filter and AllergenBlock System traps 97 percent of dust, dander, and other irritating particles. And, its large dust cup ensures less frequent emptying and longer cleaning times.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"The 25-foot power cord helps users clean whole rooms from one outlet and, when cleanup is over, it seamlessly retracts back into the vacuum's stand. An assortment of tools comes with the vacuum itself, including a pet turbo tool, dust brush, and crevice tool. The cleaning hose extends up to 12 feet to clean high-up areas or under furniture. Whether you're dealing with a fully carpeted second floor or a heavily trafficked area rug, you can rest assured that this Hoover will thoroughly clean it.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"While a normal vacuum can usually tackle both carpet and hardwood, you might want to look into a product that specializes in one or the other, especially if most of your home is one floor type. Bissell\u2019s Hard Floor Expert Canister Vacuum offers a powerful clean without damaging your floor, with felt treads on the wheels that won\u2019t leave a mark and a switch that lets you control the level of suction. The bristles of the brush are also softer than what you\u2019ll find on other models. And as with other canister-style vacuums, it\u2019s lightweight, maneuverable and cleans up easily\u2014the tank opens from the bottom, reducing the potential for mess.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"The Bissell\u2019s Hard Floor Expert vacuum is easy to carry around and does a great job of cleaning hardwood floors without marking them up.

Whole-home cleaning across multiple floor surfaces can be accomplished with an upright vacuum, while messes in smaller spaces or above-floor areas are better tackled by a stick or handheld vacuum. Hands-off cleaning is also an option, as affordable robotic vacuums are also available at Walmart.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Weight","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"If you're looking for a portable vacuum that won't be a pain to lug up and down stairs, take note of how much it weighs before making your purchase. Stick and canister vacuums tend to be lighter than upright vacuums, but they might not offer the same array of attachments that you'll find with a heavier upright model.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"Attachments","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"While they'll add weight to your vacuum, attachments will help you clean more of your home with one machine. An upholstery brush will keep your furniture crumb-free, a crevice tool will reach into nooks and crannies all over the house, and an extension hose will clear away overhead cobwebs and dust. If your chief concern is simply cleaning your floors, you might not need many attachments, but they will undoubtedly make your vacuum more versatile.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading2","text":"FAQs","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"When is the best time to buy a vacuum from Walmart?","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"While Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the winter holiday season are all excellent times to get a great deal on a vacuum at Walmart, the absolute <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/best-time-of-year-to-buy-a-vacuum-1387763#the-best-times-to-buy-a-vacuum\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">best time of year to shop for a vacuum</a> is actually the spring. From March to May, more people are cleaning their homes than they are in the winter, which inspires many retailers to run sales on vacuums, and Walmart is no exception. There's also the fact that new models often come out in June, so retailers need to make space by selling out their older models. Keep an eye out for added sales right before the turn of the month.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading3","text":"What vacuum brands does Walmart carry?","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"You can expect to find most big name brands at Walmart, including Dyson, Bissell, Hoover, Shark, Eureka, Roomba, and Dirt Devil.

Which type you choose mostly comes down to personal preferences and needs. If you don't mind spending money on replacement bags and want to make sure the dust your vacuum picks up gets tightly sealed away, a bagged vacuum will work well for you. On the other hand, you may be happier with a bagless vacuum if you don't want the added expense of replacement bags.","layout":"bodyLayout","textStyle":"bodyStyle","format":"html"},{"role":"heading2","text":"Why Trust The Spruce?","format":"html"},{"role":"body","text":"This article was written by <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/sara-coughlin-5091571\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">Sara Coughlin</a>, a freelance writer and The Spruce\u2019s small appliances expert.
